/**
 * 检索唤醒 — the query half of charter §1.5's two motions, and the entry point
 * of roadmap P3.3.
 *
 * WHAT IS *NOT* USED, AND WHY THAT IS THE DESIGN
 *
 * `@qianmo/memory`'s query supports `text` and `tags` filters. Recall passes
 * neither. Candidates are selected by **scope only** — layer, project, task,
 * period — because those are the store's table partitions, facts about where a
 * record lives rather than guesses about what a question meant. A word filter
 * here would reinstate exactly the failure D-6 measured: question wording that
 * misses the entry's wording returns zero rows, and zero rows is an answer with
 * no memory at all. Tags and keywords are ranking signals (`rank.ts`), never
 * gates.
 *
 * ONLY LIVE ENTRIES, EVERY TIME
 *
 * `query()` is called without `includeRetired`, so a revoked record is gone
 * from the very next recall — the ingest axis is not a point-in-time question
 * and no `asOf` brings it back. Nothing here caches: the block is rebuilt from
 * disk on each call, which is what makes 「废止后必须重投」 automatic rather
 * than a procedure someone has to remember.
 *
 * FAILURES ARE CARRIED OUT, NOT SWALLOWED
 *
 * The store returns partial results and records what it could not read on its
 * event channel. This function lifts those records onto the result
 * ({@link RecallResult.events}) and raises {@link RecallResult.degraded}. That
 * lift is the point: the store was fixed so one corrupt file could not take
 * recall down, and re-burying the report in the layer above would restore the
 * silence the fix removed — a node waking with less memory than it has, and
 * nothing anywhere saying so.
