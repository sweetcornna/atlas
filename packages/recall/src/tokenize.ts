/**
 * Deterministic tokenisation for the keyword half of charter N-8's retrieval.
 *
 * No model, no stemmer, no dictionary: the same string produces the same token
 * list on every machine and every run, because a ranking a reviewer cannot
 * reproduce is not evidence for AC-4.
 *
 * TWO SCRIPTS, TWO RULES
 *
 * Whitespace splitting is an alphabet-only assumption, and the memory this
 * package retrieves is largely Chinese. So Latin/digit runs become whole
 * tokens, while CJK runs become **character bigrams**: 「统一用 Bun」 yields
 * `统一`, `一用`, which lets 「本项目用什么运行时」 overlap 「统一用 Bun」
 * without a dictionary. Bigrams over-match (they will happily match across a
 * word boundary) — that is the intended trade. Over-matching costs ranking
 * precision; under-matching costs a *missing* entry, and D-6 recorded the
 * measured version of that failure: asking about 「语义搜索」 while the entry
 * says 「向量数据库」 returned zero results.
 *
 * Which is also why nothing here is allowed to *filter* candidates. These
 * tokens feed `rank.ts` only. Candidate selection is scope-based
 * (`recall.ts`), so a question whose wording overlaps nothing still gets every
 * entry injected when the store is small enough — the structural half of D-6.
 */

/**
 * CJK ideographs plus kana. Deliberately a fixed range list rather than
 * `\p{Script=Han}`: the ranges are stable across engine Unicode versions, so a
