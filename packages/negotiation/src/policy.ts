/**
 * What a lender is willing to lend, and for how long an offer stands.
 *
 * ## Why these numbers are not in `LIMITS`
 *
 * `LIMITS` is the set of numbers every node on the network has to agree on —
 * envelope size, hop count, the deadlines. How much memory *this* machine will
 * lend is not one of them: it differs per deployment, it is nobody else's
 * business, and putting it in `LIMITS` would make a local decision into a
 * network-wide constant that needs a charter amendment to change (protocol.md
 * §12.2 A sets that bar for good reasons). So the ceiling lives with the code
 * that enforces it, and the *fields* — which are the protocol's business — live
 * in `@qianmo/protocol`.
 *
 * ## The ceiling is a refusal, not a clamp — except when it is both
 *
 * A request over the ceiling is refused outright when `clampToCeiling` is off,
 * and answered with a smaller offer when it is on. Both are honest; the default
 * is to offer less, because a borrower that asked for eight cores and can use
 * two is better served by two than by a rejection. What never happens is an
 * offer larger than the request: lending more than was asked for is not
 * generosity, it is a resource leak with a friendly face.
