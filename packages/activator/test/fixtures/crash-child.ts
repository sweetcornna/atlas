/**
 * The child process `crash-recovery.test.ts` kills.
 *
 * DoD ④ is about what survives `kill -9`, and `kill -9` is not something a
 * mock can express: there is no unwinding, no `finally`, no flush. So the
 * activator really runs in its own process, really writes its journal to a real
 * file, and is really killed mid-forward. This file is that process.
 *
 * Two modes:
 *
 *   `catch`   — take one request in and then hang inside the forward, having
 *               first written a marker so the parent knows exactly which window
 *               it is killing in: after the journal record, before the forward
 *               completes.
 *   `recover` — start up, replay whatever the journal still owes, and print the
 *               report as JSON.
 *
 * Side effects go to files rather than stdout because a `kill -9` takes any
 * buffered stdout with it, and the parent needs to be able to prove that
 * nothing was forwarded — which requires evidence that survives the kill.
