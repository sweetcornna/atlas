 * DoD ③, part three: the assertion that goes into CI and stays there.
 *
 * Parts one and two prove the surface is safe *today*. This file is the part
 * that keeps it safe: a scan of `src/` that goes red the moment somebody adds a
 * destructive route, opens a second path to the network that bypasses the
 * allowlist, or — since the real API is `POST /{methodName}` with the
 * parameters in the body — finds a second way to decide what those parameters
 * are. Same mechanism as P0.7's `daemon-bind-invariant.test.ts`: a detector,
 * applied to the real artefacts, with its red direction pinned by fixtures so
 * it can never be quietly satisfied by scanning nothing.
 *
 * The detector runs over source with comments stripped. Prose has to be able to
 * *discuss* destructive verbs — this file and `capability.ts` both do, at
 * length — while code must not contain them.
