/**
 * A real HTTP server on loopback that stands in for the sandbox daemon.
 *
 * **Read this before reading any assertion in this package.** The sandbox
 * supervisor is an *external system*, not the unit under test. Nothing here
 * reproduces its real behaviour and nothing in these tests is evidence about
 * it. What the stub buys is that everything on *our* side of the port — the
 * capability allowlist, the heartbeat schedule, the retry-sooner-on-failure
 * rule, the wake coalescing, the journal, the recovery pass — runs for real,
 * over a real socket, with real JSON and real HTTP status codes, instead of
 * being asserted against a hand-written double of our own code.
 *
 * ## It does reproduce the *wire shape*, which was verified on the host
 *
 * `POST {endpoint}/{methodName}` with a bearer and a JSON parameter object;
 * method names taken verbatim from the real API; sandboxes addressed by `name`;
 * states drawn from `active` / `frozen` / `stopped`; `listSandboxes` answering
 * `{ sandboxes: [ … ] }` and `acquireSandbox` answering
 * `{ status, created, sandbox }`. That is deliberate: the first version of this
 * package was written against an invented REST shape, and a stub that agrees
 * with the invention is exactly the thing that lets an invention survive.
 *
 * It is deliberately *more* permissive than the thing it stands in for. In
 * particular it **implements `destroySandbox`**, at the same endpoint and
 * behind the same bearer as everything else — which is where the real one lives
 * too — records hits on it, and will happily serve one to any client that asks.
 * That is the control for DoD ③: a test can prove the route is live and
 * reachable, and then prove that our component cannot reach it. A stub without
 * a destroy route would make the "cannot destroy" assertion vacuous.
