/**
 * The wiring: one call that stands up a host-side activator and holds the
 * whole of DoD ① — catch, wake, probe, forward, ack — in one process.
 *
 * `activator.ts` is deliberately portless; `link.ts` supplies the two ports it
 * declares. Neither of them decides *where requests come from*, and until
 * something did, DoD ① could not be run at all. That is this file: an inbound
 * `@qianmo/transport` listener whose handler is {@link Activator.handle}.
 *
 * ## What the receipt to the sender means here
 *
 * The transport server awaits its `onMessage` handler and only then sends a
 * receipt (`server.ts`), so wiring `handle` in directly means the sender's
 * receipt arrives **after the wake completes** — seconds, per E2, not
 * milliseconds. That is a deliberate choice between two honest options:
 *
 * - *Receipt on acceptance* would be prompt, but the sender would then have no
 *   channel at all through which to hear that the wake failed: this host holds
 *   no client back to the sender, and `@qianmo/transport`'s server half cannot
 *   originate an envelope towards a connected peer. A failure would be visible
 *   only in this host's own logs — which is precisely the silence DoD ④ forbids.
 * - *Receipt on outcome* — what this does — costs the sender a longer wait and
 *   buys it an explicit verdict: `Accepted` iff the envelope reached the node
 *   inside the sandbox, `Rejected(E_UNDELIVERABLE)` otherwise, with the
 *   transport's dedup entry dropped so the sender's at-least-once retry can land
 *   rather than being absorbed as a duplicate.
 *
 * Callers must therefore give their client a drain budget larger than this
 * node's `readyTimeoutMs`; a shorter one turns a successful slow wake into a
 * client-side timeout. This node cannot see the sender's budget, so the rule is
 * written down here rather than enforced.
 *
 * ## Known limitation: the receipt carries one code, not ours
 *
 * `@qianmo/transport`'s server answers a handler that threw with a fixed
 * `E_UNDELIVERABLE`; it has no channel for a code chosen by the handler
 * (`server.ts`). So a sender can always tell *that* its envelope was refused,
 * but not *why* — `E_TTL_EXPIRED`, `E_RATE_LIMITED` and `E_UNKNOWN_AGENT` all
 * reach it as `E_UNDELIVERABLE`. The specific code is not lost, it is just
 * local: it is on the audit trail, on the error envelope in
 * {@link ActivatorNodeHandle.failures}, and on the outcome handed to
 * `onOutcome`. Widening the receipt is a `@qianmo/transport` change and belongs
 * to whoever owns the frame grammar, not to this file.
 *
 * ## Where the routing gates sit
 *
 * `activator.ts` still holds none of them: it does one lookup (destination node
 * → sandbox) and knows nothing about loops, hop counts or budgets. This file
 * composes `@qianmo/router` in front of it, in this order per inbound envelope:
 *
 *   unknown target → routing gates (hop backstop, loop key, inbound budget)
 *   → task route registration → catch/wake/forward
 *
 * The unknown-target lookup comes first because a message for a node we do not
 * host is nobody's traffic to account for; the gates come before route
 * registration and before the wake because both of those have costs a refused
 * message must not be able to spend — a wake is seconds of daemon work per
 * E2, and a route holds a channel open until the task deadline.
 *
 * Name resolution is still not here: that is the registry's.
