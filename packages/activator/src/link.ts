/**
 * The two ports DoD ① was missing: how the activator learns that the target is
 * answering, and where the envelope goes once it is.
 *
 * `activator.ts` declares {@link ReadyProbe} and {@link ForwardTarget} and
 * implements neither — deliberately, so the wake logic can be exercised without
 * a network. This file is the one implementation of both, over
 * `@qianmo/transport`, and it is what turns "catch → wake → forward" from a
 * shape into a chain that can be run end to end.
 *
 * ## Why the host dials into the sandbox, rather than waiting to be dialled
 *
 * Two reasons, both forced rather than chosen:
 *
 * 1. **A frozen node cannot dial.** It is not executing. A design in which the
 *    sandbox re-establishes the link after waking would make the activator wait
 *    on an event it can neither observe nor bound; the whole point of this
 *    component is that *it* holds the request and *it* decides when the wait is
 *    over.
 * 2. **`@qianmo/transport`'s server half cannot push.** It answers envelopes
 *    with receipts and offers no way to originate one towards a connected peer
 *    (`server.ts`). So the only direction in which a delivery can be *initiated*
 *    is client → server, which puts the client on the host.
 *
 * The activator therefore sits between two transport hops of the same protocol:
 * one it listens on (peer nodes reach it there) and one it dials (the node
 * inside the sandbox listens there). That is the same shape Knative's activator
 * has, and the reason the base's client-only transport was not enough.
 *
 * ## Why readiness is a fresh handshake and never a cached socket
 *
 * `TransportClient.isReady()` reports that the last handshake completed on a
 * socket that has not since closed. That is not the question. Freezing a
 * sandbox pauses the *process*; nothing closes its sockets, and the peer sees no
 * FIN until some timeout elsewhere fires. So a cached "ready" flag can be true
 * of a node that has been frozen for minutes. (Reasoning about what freezing
 * does and does not touch — not a measurement made here.)
 *
 * A completed pre-shared-key handshake is different: the far side has to read a
 * challenge, compute a MAC over it and answer. That is code running inside the
 * sandbox, which is exactly the claim {@link ReadyProbe} is documented to make.
 * So every probe opens a connection, completes the handshake, and drops it.
 *
 * The cost of that is one dial per poll and a connect/close pair in the target's
 * log; the knob for a deployment that minds is `readyPollIntervalMs` on the
 * activator, not a cached flag here.
 *
 * The probe is also *cheap in the sense E2 made matter*: a handshake touches
 * none of the agent's old working set, so it answers on the fast path while the
 * 9–10 s warm-up is still running. That is a feature, not a gap — protocol.md
 * §4.2 defines `ack` as class A precisely so the wake path does not have to wait
 * for a warm heap. What this probe asserts is what an A-class ack needs: the
 * node is executing and can take the envelope in.
 *
 * ## Why "forwarded" means "receipted"
 *
 * {@link TransportClient.send} returns as soon as the envelope is in the outbox,
 * whether or not the link is up. If forwarding stopped there, the activator
 * would journal `forwarded` for an envelope sitting in a queue on a link to a
 * node that may never come back — which is the silent drop DoD ④ exists to rule
 * out, only harder to see. So a forward waits for the receipt, and a link that
 * cannot produce one within the budget fails the request explicitly.
