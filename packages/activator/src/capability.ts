/**
 * The capability surface — the one file that decides what this component is
 * physically able to ask the sandbox daemon to do.
 *
 * ## The daemon's real wire shape (verified on the host, 2026-08-12)
 *
 * The supervisor is **not** REST. It is a "method name is the path segment" RPC:
 *
 * ```
 * POST {endpoint}/{methodName}
 * authorization: Bearer <token>
 * content-type: application/json
 * <JSON parameter object>
 * ```
 *
 * Source: the vendor SDK's `private async rpc(method, body)`, which does
 * `fetch(`${endpoint}/${method}`, { method: 'POST', … })`. Confirmed live:
 * `POST http://127.0.0.1:3676/listSandboxes` with a bearer and `{}` answered
 * HTTP 200.
 *
 * There are 31 such methods and **they all live on this one endpoint**, behind
 * this one bearer, including `destroySandbox`. There is no `/v1/` prefix, no
 * path parameter, no GET, and — the assumption that most needed correcting —
 * **no `touch` method at all**. An earlier version of this file routed `touch`,
 * `acquire` and `status` at invented REST paths; all three were wrong.
 *
 * ## Why this is a code artifact and not a config knob
 *
 * The daemon's credential has **no privilege tiers**: the bearer that lists
 * sandboxes is the bearer that destroys them (selection-m0.md §4). AC-6(c) —
 * "the agent cannot destroy its own sandbox" — therefore rests on exactly two
 * things: the daemon binding to loopback only (P0.7), and this component never
 * handing a destructive verb to that bearer. Learning that `destroySandbox` is
 * *one path segment away from the calls we do make* makes the allowlist more
 * load-bearing than it was under the invented REST shape, not less.
 *
 * Three layers, each of which alone would be defeated by a determined caller,
 * and which together are not:
 *
 * 1. **Type layer** — `SandboxDaemon` in `daemon.ts` declares `acquire` and
 *    `status`. There is no destructive member to call, so reaching one requires
 *    deliberately casting away the type.
 * 2. **Runtime layer** — every request is resolved through {@link resolveRoute}
 *    against {@link DAEMON_CAPABILITY_SURFACE}. An op that is not in the map is
 *    refused before any request is built, and the refusal is audited. This is
 *    the layer that catches the cast from layer 1. It is also the layer that
 *    builds the request **body**: a caller supplies a sandbox name and nothing
 *    else, so it cannot smuggle `policy`, `template` or `metadata` into an
 *    `acquireSandbox` call.
 * 3. **Shape layer** — {@link assertSurfaceIsSafe} runs on this module's own
 *    surface at import time, so a future edit that adds a destructive route to
 *    the allowlist cannot even be loaded. Under the real wire shape it gained a
 *    tooth: a route's path must be **exactly** `/` + its op name. Combined with
 *    the destructive-word scan on op names, that closes the "innocent name,
 *    dangerous path" hole by construction rather than by vocabulary — there is
 *    no name under which `destroySandbox` can be reached.
 *
 * The denylist below is **not** the mechanism. Security comes from the
 * allowlist; the denylist exists only so a refusal can say *why* in the audit
 * record, and so layer 3 has recognizable words to look for. It does not, and
 * cannot, enumerate every dangerous real method — `execCommand`, `writeFile`
 * and `updatePolicy` are all destructive enough in context and none of them
 * contains a scary word. They are refused for the reason that actually holds:
 * they are not on the allowlist.
