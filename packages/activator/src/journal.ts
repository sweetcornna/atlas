/**
 * The write-ahead journal that makes DoD ④ true.
 *
 * P2.5's fourth acceptance criterion is not "the process restarts" — a
 * supervisor gives you that. It is that a request caught by the activator and
 * then interrupted by `kill -9` ends up **either forwarded or explicitly
 * failed, never silently dropped**. Silence is the outcome to design against:
 * the sender is holding a delivery deadline, and a dropped request looks
 * exactly like a slow one until the deadline passes, at which point nobody can
 * tell whether the message was lost here or somewhere else.
 *
 * The ordering rule that buys this is one line long and everything depends on
 * it: **the `accepted` record is fsynced before the caller is told the request
 * was accepted.** Either the record is on disk, in which case a restart finds
 * it and drives it to a terminal state; or it is not, in which case acceptance
 * was never claimed and the request is still the sender's — and
 * `@qianmo/transport` delivers at least once, so it will come again.
 *
 * Append-only NDJSON, one record per line, compacted on recovery. A crash can
 * only truncate the final line, and a truncated final line is reported as
 * {@link ActivatorEventType.JournalTorn} rather than skipped quietly — the
 * whole file exists to avoid quiet skipping.
