/**
 * Stage instrumentation for the forwarding path.
 *
 * P2.5's deliverable list asks for per-stage timings on the wake path — caught
 * → wake issued → ready → first byte forwarded — and names the consumers:
 * P3.1's dormancy work and P4.1's cross-node benchmark. The stages are cut
 * where they are because E2 showed the cost is wildly uneven across them:
 * `unpause` itself is 46.6–55.5 ms, while bringing a 400 MiB working set back
 * to full speed took another 9.0–10.2 s. A single end-to-end number averages
 * those together and hides the only thing worth knowing, which is *which* of
 * them a given deployment is paying.
 *
 * Percentiles rather than means, and reported out of band. Per D-3 the latency
 * numbers belong in a standalone benchmark job, not in a blocking CI gate —
 * a blocking percentile gate on a shared runner measures the runner.
