/**
 * The activator face: catch the request, wake the node, forward once it is
 * ready.
 *
 * ## Why this layer has to exist at all
 *
 * The single-machine answer to "a request arrived for a process that is not
 * running" is socket activation: the kernel's accept queue holds the connection
 * while the service starts. **That buffer is local to the machine.** A request
 * arriving from another node has nothing holding it, and the sandbox daemon
 * listens on loopback only and offers no such layer either (measured, E1). So
 * something host-side has to hold the request, issue the wake, wait for
 * readiness, and only then forward — the role Knative gives its activator and
 * `systemd-socket-proxyd` gives a local socket. Nothing in the base does this;
 * it is the one piece of M0 with no precedent to copy.
 *
 * ## The two rules everything else follows from
 *
 * 1. **Write-ahead before acceptance.** The journal record is fsynced before
 *    this component admits it has the request. A crash before that point leaves
 *    the request with the sender, who retries; a crash after it leaves a record
 *    that recovery drives to a terminal state. There is no window in which the
 *    request is nobody's.
 * 2. **Act first, then record the terminal state.** Forwarding — or telling the
 *    sender it failed — happens *before* the terminal journal line. Crash in
 *    between and recovery replays, so the sender may hear twice; the transport
 *    is at-least-once and dedups on `msgId`, so a duplicate is absorbed. Record
 *    first and the crash costs a silent drop instead, which nothing downstream
 *    can absorb. DoD ④ asks for "forwarded or explicitly failed, never silently
 *    dropped", and that is a choice about this ordering, not about uptime.
