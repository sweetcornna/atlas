 * The keepalive face: the heartbeat that keeps a resident node out of the
 * freezer.
 *
 * ## The counter-intuitive part, first
 *
 * The obvious way to keep a sandbox alive is to configure it never to stop.
 * **That is not a fix; it is a strictly worse failure mode**, and E3 measured
 * it:
 *
 *   - A process burning 100 % CPU inside the sandbox was frozen **110 s** after
 *     start, made **zero progress for the following 411 s**, and never came
 *     back on its own. The ledger read `frozen` the whole time.
 *   - The idle judgement is refreshed **only by API entry points**. It has no
 *     visibility into CPU or IO inside the container. Work done inside the
 *     sandbox is, to the freezer, indistinguishable from idleness.
 *   - Setting `stopAfterSeconds: null` does not save the process. It removes
 *     the *stop* transition while leaving the *freeze* transition in place, so
 *     the failure is promoted from "fell to stopped, cold-starts next time"
 *     to **"frozen mid-task, silently, forever"**. The system loses the ability
 *     to recover by restarting, which was the only recovery it had.
 *
 * So: the heartbeat has to come from **outside** the sandbox, has to reach the
 * **daemon API** (nothing done inside counts), and its period has to be
 * strictly under the freeze threshold with room for a miss. That is this file.
 * {@link assertResidencyPolicy} refuses the `stopAfterSeconds: null`
 * configuration outright, so the lesson survives the departure of everyone who
 * remembers it.
 *
 * ## The beat is `acquireSandbox`, and there was never an alternative
 *
 * This file used to beat a `touch` verb. **The daemon has no `touch` method**;
 * the whole API is 31 named RPCs and none of them is it. What the host run of
 * 2026-08-12 established about the ones that exist:
 *
 *   - `acquireSandbox` **does** reset the idle clock. A sandbox's
 *     `lastActiveAt` moved from `2026-08-12T13:17:51.529Z` to
 *     `2026-08-12T13:17:57.613Z` across one call issued 6.1 s later — reset to
 *     *now*, not merely preserved. It also thaws: `frozen` became `active`.
 *   - `updatePolicy` and `updateMetadata` do **not**. The vendor documentation
 *     is explicit — "a pure ledger write: nothing is woken, and the idle clock
 *     is not refreshed". They were the obvious candidates for a
 *     minimum-privilege beat and they simply do not work.
 *   - `execCommand` does ("counts as activity for the whole run"), and running
 *     an arbitrary command inside the sandbox every period to prove we are
 *     awake is a far larger capability than the one being bought.
 *
 * So `acquireSandbox` is the beat. DoD ② was then measured against a real
 * sandbox with `freezeAfterSeconds: 60`:
 *
 *   - **Control, no heartbeat** — `active` at t=0, `frozen` by t≈45 s, and
 *     frozen thereafter.
 *   - **Experiment, one `acquireSandbox` every 20 s** — `active` for the whole
 *     120 s run, twice the freeze threshold, never once frozen.
 *
 * ## What that costs, stated plainly
 *
 * The previous version of this file claimed a real guarantee: the keepalive
 * face held `Pick<SandboxDaemon, 'touch'>`, so it "cannot even wake a sandbox"
 * — the type made a class of action unreachable from here. **That guarantee is
 * gone, and nothing replaces it.** Keeping alive and waking up are one call on
 * this daemon, so a component that can do the first can do the second. The
 * narrowing below is now a statement of what the loop uses, not a boundary it
 * cannot cross.
 *
 * What is *not* affected is the property AC-6(c) actually rests on. Reaching
 * `acquireSandbox` does not bring `destroySandbox` any closer: the allowlist in
 * `capability.ts` is what refuses that, it refuses it for every caller in this
 * package equally, and it never depended on this narrowing. `acquireSandbox` is
 * idempotent, non-destructive, and only ever moves a sandbox towards running.
 *
 * There is even a small gain to be honest about in the other direction: because
 * the beat is the wake verb, a heartbeat that loses several beats and lets the
 * sandbox freeze **thaws it on the next beat** instead of watching it stay
 * frozen. Under the imagined `touch` API the loop could only have kept
 * re-failing.
 *
 * ## Why this is the same component as the activator
 *
 * Both faces live host-side and both act on the sandbox's behalf against the
 * daemon API. Sharing one component means sharing one capability surface — and
 * that surface has no destructive verb in it (`capability.ts`). Splitting them
 * would mean two places where a destructive verb could be added, and only one
 * of them would be the one anybody audits. That argument is now doing all of
 * the work that the per-face type narrowing used to share.
