/**
 * The sandbox daemon port, and the one RPC implementation of it.
 *
 * Both faces of P2.5 — the activator and the keepalive — talk to the sandbox
 * supervisor (Dormice) through this port and through nothing else. That is not
 * tidiness: it is what makes "this component cannot destroy a sandbox" a
 * property of three small files rather than a claim about the whole codebase.
 *
 * The port is an interface because the daemon is an **external system, not the
 * unit under test**. Substituting a local stand-in for it lets every line of
 * our own scheduling, backoff, allowlist and recovery logic run for real
 * against a real socket. It does **not** make any statement about how the real
 * daemon behaves — no test in this package can, and none claims to. What the
 * stand-in *does* now reproduce is the daemon's **wire shape**, which was
 * verified on the host on 2026-08-12 and is described in `capability.ts`.
 *
 * ## Sandboxes are addressed by name, not by id
 *
 * Both calls we are allowed to make key on the sandbox's `name`:
 * `acquireSandbox` takes `{ name }`, and `listSandboxes` returns rows carrying
 * both `id` and `name`. There is no by-id lookup in the API at all. Passing an
 * id where a name belongs would not fail loudly — `acquireSandbox` creates a
 * sandbox for an unknown name (its response carries `created: boolean`) — so it
 * would quietly stand up a second sandbox named after the first one's id. Hence
 * the parameter is called `sandboxName` everywhere in this package.
 *
 * Credentials are injected as a getter and read from the environment at most.
 * Nothing key-shaped is ever written down here.
