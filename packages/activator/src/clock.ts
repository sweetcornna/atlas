/**
 * Clock, scheduler, and the time-jump gate.
 *
 * The gate is the reason this file exists. E4 measured a Bun process across
 * three freeze/thaw rounds and found:
 *
 *   - `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` **keeps advancing while the sandbox is frozen**
 *     (`gap_mono` and `gap_wall` agreed to within 10 ms across 34 s and 97 s
 *     freezes). Reaching for a monotonic clock does not dodge this; there is
 *     no clock source in the sandbox that skips the freeze.
 *   - `setInterval` does **not** replay missed ticks: a 34.7 s gap produced
 *     exactly one tick.
 *
 * Put together: at the instant of thaw, every "how long since I last saw X"
 * test crosses its threshold *simultaneously*. Without a gate a resident node
 * wakes up, concludes that its peer is gone, its in-flight deliveries have all
 * expired and its own retry budget is spent — and declares itself dead once per
 * wake. protocol.md §5.3 rule T-2 makes the gate mandatory for exactly this
 * reason, and P2.5 needs it on both faces: the heartbeat must not read a thaw
 * as "the daemon stopped answering", and the activator must not read a thaw as
 * "the target never became ready".
 *
 * Deliberately not imported from `@qianmo/transport`. That package has a gate
 * of the same lineage inside `ReconnectSchedule`, but it is welded to retry
 * budgets and is not part of that package's public surface; reaching into
 * another package's internals to share nine lines of arithmetic would buy a
 * coupling worth far more than the nine lines. The shapes differ too: there,
 * a jump resets an attempt budget; here, it opens a grace window during which
 * deadline judgements are suspended.
