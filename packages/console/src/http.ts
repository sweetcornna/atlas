 * The console's HTTP face: one page, a handful of JSON routes and three HTML
 * fragments, over `Bun.serve`.
 *
 * Shaped like `packages/registry/src/http.ts` — hand-written routing, no
 * framework, {@link createConsoleHandler} exposed separately from
 * {@link startConsoleServer} so every route can be exercised with a plain
 * `Request` and a fake port, without binding anything.
 *
 * ## Route table
 *
 * | Method | Path | Role | Returns |
 * | --- | --- | --- | --- |
 * | GET | `/` | view | `text/html`, the whole page |
 * | GET | `/login` | public | `text/html`, the token field |
 * | POST | `/login` | public | 303 + `Set-Cookie`, or the field again |
 * | POST | `/logout` | public | 303 + a cleared cookie |
 * | GET | `/assets/app.css` | public | `text/css` |
 * | GET | `/assets/app.js` | public | `text/javascript` |
 * | GET | `/v0/health` | public | `{ status: 'ok' }` |
 * | GET | `/v0/agents` | view | `{ agents }` |
 * | POST | `/v0/agents` | admin | the registered `ConsoleAgent` |
 * | DELETE | `/v0/agents/<enc address>` | admin | 204 |
 * | POST | `/v0/agents/<enc address>/heartbeat` | admin | `ConsoleAgent` |
 * | GET | `/v0/audit?…` | view | `AuditPage` |
 * | GET | `/v0/audit/chain/<enc traceId>` | view | `{ chain }`, may be null |
 * | GET | `/v0/limits` | view | `LimitsSnapshot` |
 * | GET | `/v0/servers` | view | `{ servers }`, or 501 without a mapping |
 * | PUT | `/v0/servers/<enc server>/note` | admin | the stored `ServerNote` |
 * | POST | `/v0/wake` | admin | `WakeOutcome`, or 501 without a wake port |
 * | GET | `/fragments/{roster,audit,limits}` | view | `text/html` fragment |
 * | GET | `/fragments/chain/<enc traceId>` | view | `text/html` fragment |
 * | GET | `/chat?session=<id>` | **admin** | `text/html`, the chat page |
 * | GET | `/v0/chat/targets` | **admin** | `{ targets }` |
 * | GET | `/v0/chat/sessions` | **admin** | `{ sessions }` |
 * | POST | `/v0/chat/sessions` | **admin** | the opened `ChatSession` |
 * | GET | `/v0/chat/sessions/<enc id>` | **admin** | `ChatTranscript` |
 * | POST | `/v0/chat/sessions/<enc id>/messages` | **admin** | the operator `ChatTurn` |
 * | GET | `/v0/chat/stream` | **admin** | `text/event-stream` |
 * | GET | `/fragments/chat/sessions?active=<id>` | **admin** | `text/html` fragment |
 * | GET | `/fragments/chat/thread/<enc id>` | **admin** | `text/html` fragment |
 *
 * ## Chat is admin-only, all of it
 *
 * Every row above with `chat` in it needs the admin token, **including the
 * read-only ones**. Two reasons, and either alone would be enough: sending
 * spends the far node's model budget, and a transcript is the one thing on this
 * console that contains free-form content rather than ids and counts — §7.2
 * says the rest of the page never touches a payload, and this page is the
 * exception. A view token therefore does not merely fail to send; it cannot see
 * that the conversation exists. The ledger page hides the nav link for the same
 * reason it hides it when there is no chat channel at all.
 *
 * When `deps.chat` is absent, `/chat` answers **404** (there is no such page on
 * this instance) while `/v0/chat/*` answers **501** (the route exists in this
 * version; this console has no channel behind it). A browser gets the honest
 * answer and a script gets the diagnosable one. Both are still behind the admin
 * check, so an anonymous caller cannot probe which consoles have chat wired.
 *
 * The last row is an addition to the agreed table, not a redesign of it: the
 * view layer exports `renderChain` and the trace cells it renders carry
 * `data-action="chain"`, so the client needs somewhere to fetch that panel
 * from as **markup**. The JSON `/v0/audit/chain/…` route stays exactly as
 * specified, for callers that want the data.
 *
 * ## A server id is chosen from the startup list, never supplied
 *
 * `PUT /v0/servers/<id>/note` looks the id up in `deps.nodeServers` before it
 * reads the body, and answers 403 when it is not there. This is the same rule
 * `handleWake` applies to a wake target and it is there for the same reason: the
 * set of things this console will act on is fixed when it starts, so a caller
 * holding the admin token cannot grow it by typing into the page. Without the
 * check, a note route would be an arbitrary key-value store that anyone with
 * that token could fill up.
 *
 * A console started without any `--node-server` answers 501 on both routes
 * rather than 200 with an empty list: "this console was not told where anything
 * runs" and "nothing runs anywhere" are different facts.
 *
 * The two asset routes are public because a browser does not attach the
 * console's credential to a `<link>` or `<script>` it discovers inside a page
 * (see `auth.ts` on where the token rides). They are compiled-in constants
 * containing no instance data, so serving them to an anonymous local caller
 * gives nothing away; gating them would only produce an unstyled page.
 *
 * The whole address rides in **one** percent-encoded path segment, the same
 * convention the registry uses (`qianmo%3A%2F%2Fnode-b%2Freviewer`): `URL`
 * leaves the escapes alone, so the split still yields the expected segment
 * count and one `decodeURIComponent` hands the address back.
 *
 * ## A port that is down is not a 500
 *
 * Every `ConsoleDeps` port answers with a typed failure instead of throwing,
 * and this layer keeps that promise visible: a failure becomes the status that
 * describes it (503 when the registry is unreachable, 404 when the address is
 * gone, …) carrying `failure.message`, never a 500.
 *
 * The HTML routes go further and do not fail at all. **The page must open when
 * the registry is down** — that is when someone is looking at it. So `/` and
 * the fragments hand `(value | null, failure | null)` to the view layer and
 * answer 200 with a page that renders the failure in place of the panel it
 * belongs to. A console that 503s as a whole because one of three panels could
 * not load is a console that tells you nothing at the moment you need it.
 *
 * ## 401 before 405
 *
 * Role is checked before the method on every non-public route: an anonymous
 * caller should not learn which verbs a route accepts. Unknown paths answer
 * 404 without consulting the credential at all — there is no role that would
 * make them exist. Neither 401 nor 403 ever echoes the token it received.
 *
 * ## Three protection classes, because a cookie is ambient
 *
 * Since `POST /login` may hand the browser a cookie, every route has to say
 * what an ambient credential is allowed to do on it. `auth.ts` holds the
 * argument; this file holds the assignment, and there are exactly three values:
 *
 * - **`document`** — `GET /` and `GET /chat`. A cookie alone is enough: a
 *   top-level navigation cannot carry a custom header, and a foreign page that
 *   forces one still cannot read the response or change anything by causing it.
 * - **`stream`** — `GET /v0/chat/stream`, which is an `EventSource` and equally
 *   header-less. A cookie alone is enough *unless* `Sec-Fetch-Site` says the
 *   caller is another origin, which is the one case `SameSite` misses because
 *   it ignores the port.
 * - **`guarded`** — everything else that needs a credential: every write, every
 *   JSON read, every HTML fragment. A cookie must be accompanied by the
 *   {@link CONSOLE_HEADER} header, which a cross-origin caller cannot set
 *   without a preflight this server never answers.
 *
 * The `Bearer` and `?token=` positions are unaffected in all three: they are
 * not ambient, so they are not a CSRF vector.
 *
 * ## Unauthenticated: a redirect for a browser, a 401 for everything else
 *
 * A `GET` whose `Accept` asks for `text/html` is a person in a browser, and
 * sending them a JSON 401 they cannot act on is how a console gets a reputation
 * for being broken — they get a 303 to `/login` with a validated `redirect`
 * back. Everything else keeps the 401 JSON exactly as before, because a `curl`
 * or a poller that gets HTML and a 200 instead of a 401 has been lied to. The
 * one refinement is 403: an operator holding a view token who navigates to an
 * admin page is shown the login card **in place**, with the reason, rather than
 * being bounced to `/login` — they are already authenticated, so a page that
 * redirected them would redirect them straight back.
