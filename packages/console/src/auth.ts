 * Who may read the console, who may act through it, and where the two tokens
 * come from.
 *
 * ## Two tokens, not one with a flag
 *
 * The same reasoning as the backup service (`packages/backup/src/service.ts`):
 * the console's read face shows a roster and an audit trail, while its write
 * face registers agents, drops them and wakes nodes. A single token with a
 * scope field would put "a viewer cannot wake a node" one boolean away from
 * being wrong. So there are two strings, compared separately, and the admin
 * token is a strict superset of the view token's rights — never the other way
 * around.
 *
 * Comparison is length-independent for the same reason the transport handshake
 * is: a timing side channel on a bearer token is cheap to avoid and expensive
 * to discover.
 *
 * ## Where the token rides
 *
 * Three places, checked in this order by {@link presentedCredentialOf}, first
 * one that resolves to a role wins:
 *
 * - `Authorization: Bearer <token>` — what the page's `fetch()` calls and any
 *   `curl` use.
 * - `?token=<token>` on the query string — what a **browser navigation** uses,
 *   because a URL typed or clicked into an address bar cannot carry a header.
 *   That is the whole reason the CLI prints a URL with the token in it.
 * - the {@link SESSION_COOKIE} cookie — what a browser has after `POST /login`,
 *   so that opening the console means typing a token into a field rather than
 *   hand-splicing one into a URL.
 *
 * A token in a URL is a real (smaller) exposure — shell history, the address
 * bar, a `Referer` header. The HTTP layer answers the last one with
 * `referrer-policy: no-referrer`; the first two are accepted, because the
 * alternative is a console nobody can open.
 *
 * ## The cookie, and what it costs
 *
 * This file used to say the cookie was refused on purpose, and the reason it
 * gave was right: a cookie is **ambient**, attached by the browser to requests
 * the operator's page did not make, which is what turns a write route into a
 * CSRF target. Handing the credential to a field on a login page does not make
 * that argument wrong — it makes it a bill that has to be paid, in three
 * instalments. All three are here rather than spread over the route table,
 * because a CSRF defence assembled from pieces in four files is a CSRF defence
 * nobody can audit.
 *
 * **① The cookie is `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict`, `Path=/`, host-only.** No
 * `Domain`, so a sibling host cannot claim it, and no script can read it — a
 * strict improvement on the `localStorage` copy the page already keeps, which
 * any injected script could lift.
 *
 * **② `Secure` only when the request really arrived over TLS.** See
 * {@link isSecureRequest}. Setting it unconditionally would be the safer-looking
 * choice and the wrong one: the console is also reached at
 * `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` through an SSH tunnel, and a `Secure` cookie is
 * simply never sent back there, so the login page would accept the token and
 * then bounce the operator straight back to itself.
 *
 * **③ `SameSite=Strict` is not enough, because it ignores the port.** Same-site
 * is scheme + registrable domain; `http://127.0.0.1:9999` — any other local web
 * app, on a machine where this console binds loopback precisely because loopback
 * is trusted — is same-site with this console and its cookie will ride along. So
 * every route that is not a plain document read additionally requires the
 * {@link CONSOLE_HEADER} request header when the credential came from the
 * cookie, and this server answers **no** CORS preflight and sends no
 * `Access-Control-Allow-*` header of any kind. A foreign page can therefore
 * neither set that header (custom headers force a preflight) nor survive the
 * preflight (there is no answer to it). The `Bearer` and `?token=` positions are
 * exempt because they are not ambient: a page that can supply either of them
 * already knows the token, and CSRF is an attack by somebody who does not.
 *
 * **Documents are the deliberate exception.** A top-level navigation — the
 * address bar, a bookmark, a link — cannot carry a custom header, so `GET /`,
 * `GET /chat` and `GET /login` accept the cookie alone. That is safe for a
 * reason worth stating rather than assuming: a foreign site can make the
 * browser *navigate* here, but the same-origin policy stops it reading a byte
 * of what comes back, and rendering a page changes nothing on this console or
 * on the network behind it. The moment such a page wants to *do* something it
 * needs one of the JSON routes, and those are back under rule ③.
 *
 * `GET /v0/chat/stream` gets the same exception for the same structural reason
 * (`EventSource` cannot send headers either) plus one guard of its own: a
 * cookie-only stream request is refused when `Sec-Fetch-Site` says the caller is
 * another origin. That header is set by the browser and cannot be forged by
 * page script, and `same-site` is exactly the value the port-blind rule above
 * would otherwise wave through. It is a belt over braces, never the braces:
 * browsers that do not send it fall back to the rules above, which is why the
 * custom header is what actually fails closed.
