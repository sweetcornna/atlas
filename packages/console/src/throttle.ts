 * Failure backoff for `POST /login`.
 *
 * A console token is a 32-character random string, so this is not defending a
 * human-chosen password — it is defending against the thing a login *form*
 * newly makes possible. Before the form existed, guessing meant driving the
 * JSON API with a script, which is a thing an operator would have to build; a
 * text box on a page that answers 200 or 401 is a guessing oracle that anyone
 * who finds the port can drive from a browser tab. An input box on a public
 * address with no backoff behind it is an online brute-force target, whatever
 * the entropy of the secret behind it.
 *
 * **The reverse proxy in front of this cannot stand in for it.** `limit_req`
 * there is per-location and this console's live surfaces (the SSE stream, the
 * five-second poller) are exactly the ones such a rule is usually written to
 * skip; a defence that lives in a config file this repository does not own is a
 * defence nobody can test.
 *
 * In-memory on purpose: the console holds no state that survives a restart —
 * its tokens do not either, when they are generated — and persisting attacker
 * counters would mean inventing a file for them. A restart honestly forgets.
 *
 * Keyed by whatever the caller passes, which in `http.ts` is the peer address
 * of the socket and **never** `X-Forwarded-For`: that header is written by the
 * client on a directly-reached console, so trusting it would let one attacker
 * mint a fresh bucket per attempt and delete this file's reason to exist.
 * Behind a single reverse proxy the consequence is that every client shares
 * `127.0.0.1` and this collapses into one global throttle. That is accepted,
 * and for a console with exactly two tokens it is arguably the right shape:
 * what is being guessed at is the *console*, not the caller. It does mean one
 * clumsy operator can lock out the rest for up to {@link MAX_DELAY_SECONDS} —
 * five minutes of waiting is the price, and the alternative was an unbounded
 * guessing rate.
