/**
 * The roster: who is on the network, and which of them is answering.
 *
 * This is the read half of M1's exit test — *内测用户无需接触 CLI 即可完成注册与
 * 查看*. The write half is the register form in `page.ts`; the two are one
 * feature, which is why the empty state here does not just say "none". An
 * empty registry is the state a first-time user is *guaranteed* to be in, and
 * a blank list there fails the exit test at the only moment it is being taken.
 *
 * ## One card per node, one disclosure row per agent
 *
 * The roster used to be an eight-column table with `table-layout: fixed` and
 * every value clipped to an ellipsis, because the widest legitimate value in
 * some columns is longer than the column that has to hold it. Grouping by node
 * removes the column-budget problem rather than tuning it: the node appears
 * once in a card header instead of once per row, the row keeps four things
 * (address, status, lease, heartbeat), and everything else — capabilities,
 * endpoint, key fingerprint, the exact heartbeat clock and the deregister
 * button — moves into a native `<details>` panel that opens under the row.
 *
 * `<details>`, not a script: the panel opens with JavaScript disabled, and the
 * five-second poller that replaces this whole fragment cannot leave a
 * half-opened row behind because the browser re-parses the markup fresh.
 *
 * ## The address is the signature element
 *
 * `qianmo://node-a/reviewer` renders with its *agent* segment as a terracotta
 * pill. That is the one piece of the string an operator is actually scanning
 * for, and it is the reason the node grouping reads as grouping rather than as
 * repetition. {@link splitAddress} is deliberately forgiving: an address that
 * does not parse is shown whole, in the group named by the whole string, rather
 * than dropped.
 *
 * ## Every value is hostile input
 *
 * `address`, `endpoint`, `capabilities` and `status` are whatever the peer that
 * registered chose to send. `status` in particular is typed `string`, not the
 * registry's enum, so a peer can put a tag in it. Nothing is interpolated
 * without `escapeHtml`/`attr` — see `escape.ts` for why there is no exception
 * list. Long values are contained by CSS (`overflow-wrap`, ellipsis inside a
 * fixed-width `.addr`) rather than by a column budget, so one hostile
 * capability string can no longer squeeze a neighbour to one character a line.
 *
 * ## The rail is gone; the numbers are not
 *
 * The 140px noun column every row used to open with has been replaced by a
 * stacked section header. The counts it carried (`4 · 在线 2 · 滞后 1`) are now
 * the header's right-hand side, and the same numbers still ride out as `data-*`
 * on the header element so `page.ts` can build the overview cards without a
 * second pass over the roster (see `sectionHead` in `bits.ts`).
