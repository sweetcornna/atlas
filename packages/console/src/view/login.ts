/**
 * The `/login` document: one field, one button, and what the two tokens do.
 *
 * ## Why it is a third document rather than a panel on the first
 *
 * The ledger page and the chat page are both things an authenticated operator
 * looks at; this is the door. Rendering it as a state of `renderPage` would
 * mean the roster markup, the wake form and the client script all exist in the
 * response an anonymous caller gets back, which is a wide surface to hand out
 * for the sake of reusing a shell.
 *
 * ## No script at all
 *
 * This is the only page in the package with no `<script>`. The form is a native
 * `POST` to `/login`, so the door still works when script is off, when the
 * client bundle fails to parse, and in the browser somebody keeps around for
 * exactly one job. It also means the page cannot read the credential back out
 * of the field — the cookie it receives is `HttpOnly` and nothing here would
 * know what to do with it anyway (`auth.ts`).
 *
 * ## The shape
 *
 * A panel floating on the cream ground, with two soft blobs behind it. The
 * blobs are inline `<svg>` circles filled from the palette's own tokens, which
 * is the only way this page gets a decorative element at all: there is no build
 * step, no image route, and the CSP allows no host to supply one.
 *
 * The two-role legend under the button is new and is the one thing on this page
 * that is not chrome. Both tokens land on the same field, the console has no
 * account system to tell them apart in advance (`console.md` §8.1), and an
 * operator pasting the view token and then finding no wake button assumes the
 * console is broken. Two lines here cost less than that support round trip.
 *
 * ## What the error line may say
 *
 * Two states, and neither distinguishes "no such token" from "wrong token" —
 * there are only two valid strings on this console and telling a guesser which
 * half of the pair they got close to is free information. The refusal never
 * echoes what was typed, for the same reason `http.ts` never echoes a token
 * into a 401: a credential in a response ends up in a log or a screenshot.
