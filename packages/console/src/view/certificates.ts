/**
 * The certificate column — key-distribution.md §10.1, and nothing beyond it.
 *
 * ## Read-only, and structurally so
 *
 * §10.2 decided the console does **not** sign or rotate, and the argument was
 * not workload: a CA whose private key sits behind an HTTP face has given up
 * the offline root that two of §3.3's three benefits rest on, and a console
 * with no account system (`console.md` §8.1) could not attribute the signing
 * to a person anyway. So there is no button here. What there is instead is
 * §10.2's compromise: the row of a certificate that is running out shows the
 * `qm ca issue` command line for an operator to copy, and does not run it —
 * the same trade `console.md` §4.4 makes for a button that would always fail.
 *
 * ## Everything on this page is public material
 *
 * Status verdicts, `fingerprint256`, `notAfter`, and the revocation list's two
 * clocks. No private key, of any of the three kinds §10.3 names, can reach
 * this file — `ConsoleCertificate` has no field one could arrive in.
 *
 * The fingerprint is shown **whole**, unlike the public-key column next to it
 * which shows a hash of its input. That is not an inconsistency: the whole
 * point of `fingerprint256` is that it is the value an operator compares
 * against the runbook by eye, and a truncated one cannot be compared.
 *
 * ## The revocation bar is the most important thing here
 *
 * §10.1 says so in as many words, and §6.4 is why: a stale revocation list
 * silently fails the whole network closed to its `--trust` entries. Without a
 * conspicuous line saying when the list expires, an operator sees only "some
 * nodes suddenly cannot connect" and has no thread to pull.
