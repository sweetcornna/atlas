 *   record lapsed while its heartbeat is fresh still reads as dead, because the
 *   registry's verdict is the one that decides whether messages get routed.
 * - **Never heard from falls back to the lease.** With no heartbeat there is no
 *   age to divide, so the elapsed part is derived from `expiresAt` instead;
 *   `expiresAt` is `lastHeartbeatAt + ttl` for a node that ever spoke, so the
