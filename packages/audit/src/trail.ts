/**
 * The append-only trail on disk, and the honest version of "cannot be changed".
 *
 * ## What is actually enforced, and what is only detectable
 *
 * P7.2's DoD says "审计日志的修改尝试被拒". Three different things could mean,
 * and they are worth separating because only two of them are true here:
 *
 * 1. **The writer cannot modify** — enforced. The file descriptor is opened
 *    `O_APPEND | O_NOFOLLOW`, so every write lands at the end whatever offset
 *    anyone thinks they are at, and this class has no method that seeks,
 *    truncates, rewrites or deletes. There is no API through which the running
 *    system can alter its own history.
 * 2. **An outside edit is detectable** — enforced. Each record carries the
 *    hash of the previous one, so changing, removing or reordering any line
 *    breaks the chain from that point on and {@link readTrail} reports the
 *    first break by sequence number.
 * 3. **An outside edit is prevented** — **not** enforced. An operator with
 *    write access can still rewrite the file and recompute the chain, but an
 *    off-host witness detects that rewrite once the affected prefix is
 *    anchored. The exception is the anchoring window; its boundary and
 *    deployment conditions live in `docs/dev/audit-witness.md` §7.
 *
 * Same file discipline as `@qianmo/sandbox`'s audit — 0700 directory, 0600
 * file, `fsync` per record — because a trail that loses its last lines in a
 * crash is a trail that goes blank exactly when it is being consulted.
