/**
 * One line of the network's audit trail.
 *
 * ## Why every layer writes the same record shape
 *
 * The question P7.2 has to answer is "take one cross-node task and show me
 * everything that happened to it — **including the messages that were dropped,
 * rate-limited or deduplicated**". Those three live in three different packages
 * with three different event enums, and a reconstruction that had to join across
 * three shapes would be a reconstruction nobody runs at three in the morning.
 *
 * So the trail is one file of one shape, and each layer's own audit log stays
 * where it is — the ring buffers are for a running process, this is for the
 * question asked later. `source` says which layer wrote the line; `kind` is that
 * layer's own event name, verbatim, so nothing is lost in translation.
 *
 * ## The correlation keys, and the one that actually works
 *
 * `traceId` is the chain key (§7.1): its trace-id segment survives every hop,
 * which is exactly what "reconstruct the chain" needs. `taskId` is the
 * request/reply correlation key (C-1) and `msgId` identifies one transmission.
 * All three are optional because plenty of real events have only one of them —
 * a rate-limited message never got a task, a keepalive tick never had either.
