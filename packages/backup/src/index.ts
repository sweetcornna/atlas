/**
 * `@qianmo/backup` — workspace snapshots an agent can make but cannot reach
 * (P4.4, charter AC-6(b)(c)).
 *
 * The whole package exists to hold one asymmetry that a filesystem cannot
 * express: **create yes, remove no**. On POSIX the right to unlink a file comes
 * from write permission on its directory — the same bit that lets you create
 * one — so "the agent may add backups but not delete them" is not a mode you
 * can chmod. It is a boundary you have to put a process behind.
 *
 * So: the store lives on the host (`store.ts`), the sandbox reaches it only
 * through an allowlisted socket surface with no removal verb (`service.ts`),
 * snapshots are taken on a period and before each task (`schedule.ts`), and a
 * restore puts a deleted workspace back into an empty directory after checking
 * the archive against the digest recorded when it was stored (`restore.ts`).
 *
 * **Not** used: the sandbox platform's own archive feature. Charter §3.2 R-4
 * settled that — its archive *moves* the object rather than copying it, so the
 * source is gone once a restore succeeds and there is never a second copy.
 * That is zero coverage for AC-6(b), which is a question about surviving a
 * deletion.
