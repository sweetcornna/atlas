/**
 * The two faces of the backup store, and the asymmetry between them.
 *
 * Charter AC-6 asks for a property that sounds like a permission setting and is
 * not one: an agent must be able to *create* backups and must not be able to
 * remove them. On a POSIX filesystem that combination does not exist — the
 * right to unlink a file comes from write permission on its **directory**, the
 * same bit that lets you create one. The sticky bit narrows it to "delete only
 * your own", which is exactly the case that matters here and therefore no help
 * at all.
 *
 * So the boundary is not a file mode. It is that the store lives on the other
 * side of a socket the sandbox can reach only through a surface with no verb
 * for removal — the same shape P2.5 gave the sandbox supervisor, and for the
 * same reason: a capability that cannot be named cannot be called by a
 * confused, compromised or merely creative agent.
 *
 * | face          | who holds it | verbs                        |
 * |---------------|--------------|------------------------------|
 * | {@link SnapshotWriter} | the sandbox | create, and nothing else |
 * | {@link SnapshotArchive} | the host  | list, read, restore      |
 *
 * There is no `delete` on either. Retention is a host-side decision M0 does not
 * make (charter N-12 keeps tuning out of M0); when it arrives it belongs to the
 * archive face, never to the writer's.
