 * Resource negotiation: the four messages that lend one node's capacity to
 * another (P5.2, protocol.md §13).
 *
 * ```
 *   borrower                                   lender
 *      │  resource.request  ────────────────▶    │   "I need this much, for this"
 *      │  ◀────────────────  resource.offer      │   "you may have this much, until T"
 *      │  resource.grant    ────────────────▶    │   "I take offer X"
 *      │  ◀───────────────  resource.release     │   (either side, any time)
 * ```
 *
 * ## Four messages, and why not five
 *
 * The obvious fifth is an explicit acknowledgement of the grant. It is absent
 * on purpose: the lease's proof is the **capability token the offer carries**,
 * and the borrower demonstrates possession by using it. A message whose only
 * job is to say "yes, really" adds a state to every timeout table for no fact
 * anyone can act on.
 *
 * ## Where the user's confirmation lives
 *
 * Lending a machine's CPU is the lender's user's decision, so it is made **at
 * the lender, locally**, before an offer goes out. It is deliberately not a
 * field on any of these messages: a borrower asserting "my user approved this"
 * is precisely the confused-deputy shape charter C-5 forbids, and rule S-1
 * already refuses a remote `user-confirmed` token. What crosses the wire is the
 * lender's own token, which the lender will accept back because it signed it.
 *
 * ## The ceilings are not protocol constants
 *
 * `LIMITS` holds the numbers every node on the network must agree on. How much
 * memory a particular machine is willing to lend is not one of them — it is
 * that machine's policy, it differs per deployment, and putting it in `LIMITS`
 * would turn a local decision into a network-wide one that needs a charter
 * amendment to change. The ceilings live with the code that enforces them, in
 * `@qianmo/negotiation`.
