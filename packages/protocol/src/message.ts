 * right before handing a message to the transport, first time or n-th time.

 * True when `value` is a well-formed {@link NotifyPayload}.

 * ## Why this one is a whitelist where `ack` counts keys
 *
 * `isAckPayload` demands an *exact* key set, which is the right shape for a
 * payload that has no optional fields: it says "a field this version does not
 * understand is a field nobody verified". `notify` has four optional fields, so
 * an exact count cannot express it — and the property exact counting buys
 * beyond a whitelist is "both ends must be the same version", which for this
 * type is a liability rather than an asset: the whole point of §14.6's
 * capability discovery is that a newer sender and an older receiver stay
 * interoperable.
 *
 * `isTaskResultPayload` sat with `ack` until P13.5 gave it {@link Redelivered},
 * and it now uses the same required-plus-whitelist shape for the same reason —
 * one optional field is still one more than an exact count can express.
 *
 * A whitelist keeps the property that actually matters — a remote peer cannot
 * smuggle business fields in — because an unlisted key is still a rejection.
 * **Do not "unify" this back to `hasExactKeys`**: every `notify` carrying an
 * optional field would start being refused as malformed.

 * 2. **`taskTtlMs === deliverTtlMs`.** `notify` never enters the task state
 *    machine, but the envelope field is mandatory. Leaving it at the 5-minute
 *    default would leave a notification whose delivery window has already closed
 *    looking alive for another four and a half minutes to anything reading the
 *    state machine.
 * 3. **No `ack` is requested.** Not expressible in the envelope, and that is the
 *    point: A-class `ack` is defined (§4.3) as "the target agent took this into
 *    its input", and the hub is not an agent and has no mailbox to read from.
 *    Delivery evidence for `notify` is the transport receipt plus the sender's
