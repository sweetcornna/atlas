/**
 * Capability tokens: the wire shape of authorization (protocol.md §10.1, D-8).
 *
 * Types, encoding and structural validation only — signing and verification
 * need a key and therefore live in `@qianmo/capability`. The split is the same
 * one this package makes everywhere: what a valid message *looks like* is
 * shared by every node and every tool; what a node *can prove* is not.
 *
 * ## Why a per-node signature and not the pre-shared key
 *
 * The PSK is symmetric, so any node holding it can mint a token that claims to
 * come from any other node — including a token that claims the user confirmed
 * something. That would turn charter C-5 ("a message must not authorize on the
 * user's behalf") from a structural guarantee into a promise. With per-node
 * Ed25519, `user-confirmed` is a signature only the target node's own private
 * key can produce, so a remote peer is not *unwilling* to forge it — it is
 * unable (rule S-1).
 *
 * ## Encoding, fixed here and nowhere else
 *
 * Public keys are base64url without padding, 43 characters — RFC 8037's OKP
 * `x` parameter, which is exactly what `node:crypto` hands back from a JWK
 * export, so no re-encoding step can disagree with another. protocol.md §10.1
 * says this encoding is defined once; {@link PUBLIC_KEY_PATTERN} is that once,
 * and `@qianmo/registry` and `@qianmo/capability` both import it rather than
 * writing their own.
 *
 * ## The token is `<claims>.<sig>`, and the signature covers the bytes as sent
 *
 * A detached signature over *re-serialized* claims would need a canonical JSON
 * encoding, and every canonicalization scheme is a source of "these two are the
 * same object but not the same bytes" bugs (§7.2 hit the same wall and answered
 * it by hashing an array). So verification signs and checks the claims segment
 * **exactly as it travelled**, and only then parses it. Nothing has to agree
 * about key order because nothing re-encodes.
