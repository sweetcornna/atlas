/**
 * The node-certificate binding format (`key-distribution.md` §4.2).
 *
 * A node certificate carries three classes of `subjectAltName`, and each one
 * answers a different question:
 *
 *   DNS:<host> [, IP:<addr>]              what TLS itself demands (F-9)
 *   URI:qianmo://<node>                   which node this is
 *   URI:qianmo-nodekey:<43 chars>         which Ed25519 key that node signs with
 *
 * §4.2 says this format is fixed and "两处不得各写一份", so both halves live
 * here: the host-side CA tool builds the openssl `subjectAltName=` line with
 * {@link formatNodeSanEntries}, and the node side reads it back out of
 * `node:crypto`'s `X509Certificate.subjectAltName` with
 * {@link parseNodeCertificateBinding}. One writer, one reader, one shape.
 *
 * ## Why it lives in this package rather than beside the CA tool
 *
 * §4.2's closing rule: the 43-character base64url public-key encoding has
 * exactly one definition (`PUBLIC_KEY_PATTERN`, protocol.md §10.1), and the
 * certificate is not allowed to grow a second regex for it. Putting the format
 * next to `isNodePublicKey` is what makes that structurally true instead of a
 * convention. Nothing here touches openssl, the CA directory or the file
 * system — this is a string format, and the tooling that issues certificates
 * stays host-side (§6.1).
 *
 * ## The host classes are not classified here
 *
 * Deciding whether `10.0.0.4` is an IP literal or a hostname needs `node:net`,
 * and this package deliberately imports nothing. The caller passes the two
 * lists already separated; getting that wrong is a local mistake with a loud
 * failure (openssl rejects `IP:not-an-ip`), not a silent one.
