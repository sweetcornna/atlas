/**
 * `@qianmo/transport` — one hop of the Qianmo network.
 *
 * A long-lived WebSocket between two nodes, with the four properties P2.2
 * asks for and nothing else:
 *
 * 1. **a listening half** (`server.ts`) — the piece the base does not have at
 *    all: its 3,326 lines of transport are entirely client-side;
 * 2. **an authenticated handshake** (`handshake.ts`) — originally a
 *    pre-shared key, explicitly not production grade (charter N-3), now
 *    joined inside frame version 1 by the two-way Ed25519 signature that
 *    replaces it (key-distribution.md §7.1); both live at once because a
 *    version bump cannot stage a migration, and the limits of each are
 *    written down where the code is rather than only in a document;
 * 3. **reconnect with backoff and a time-jump gate** (`backoff.ts`), because a
 *    frozen node's clock keeps running and would otherwise wake to find its
 *    whole retry budget spent (E4);
 * 4. **at-least-once delivery** (`client.ts`) paired with **two-level
 *    receiver-side dedup** (`dedup.ts`) — retransmission is the price of not
 *    losing messages, and dedup is what makes that price payable.
 *
 * What is deliberately *not* here: routing, loop detection, rate limiting,
 * TTL enforcement and the mailbox hand-off. Those are the router's and
 * `@qianmo/adapter`'s, and this package stays a leaf that imports nothing from
 * the base runtime.
