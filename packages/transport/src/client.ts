/**
 * The dialling half of a Qianmo hop.
 *
 * At-least-once lives here, and it is one rule: **an envelope leaves the
 * outbox only when a receipt for it comes back.** Everything else follows —
 * a message handed over while the link is down waits in the outbox; a
 * reconnect replays whatever is still in it, in order; the receiver's dedup
 * (`dedup.ts`) absorbs whatever that replay duplicates. There is deliberately
 * no "sent, probably fine" state in between.
 *
 * This is where it parts company with the base's client, which retires its
 * buffer against an `X-Last-Request-Id` header supplied by the upstream
 * service (`src/cli/transports/WebSocketTransport.ts:582-642`). That contract
 * belongs to that service; ours is the receipt frame, and ours has to survive
 * the peer restarting with no memory of the connection.
 *
 * **Not done here, on purpose**: the outbox does not expire its own entries at
 * the delivery deadline. protocol.md §8.2 row 7 (`queued → expired`) is a
 * state-machine transition that has to emit `error(E_TTL_EXPIRED)` back to
 * whoever asked for the send, and that state machine belongs to the router
 * (P4.2), not to a transport that would have to invent the reporting channel
 * to do it. A long outage therefore replays envelopes that are already past
 * their deadline; the receiving node refuses them by rule T-1's second check.
