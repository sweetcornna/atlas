 * acceptance criterion, and an operator with no record of rejected dials
 * cannot tell a misconfigured peer from an attack. The records live in this
 * package instead of the base's telemetry for two reasons: the base's logging
 * is wired to session analytics (a cross-node dial is not a session event),
 * and a leaf package with no `src/` imports cannot pull the CLI's module graph
 * into a headless node.
 *
 * Nothing here may carry a secret or payload content: records are meant to be
 * printable.
