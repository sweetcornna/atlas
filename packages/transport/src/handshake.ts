/**
 * Pre-shared-key handshake — **explicitly not production grade** (charter N-3).
 *
 * What it does: proves that the dialer holds the same secret as the listener,
 * over a server-chosen single-use nonce, so a captured handshake cannot be
 * replayed onto a second connection.
 *
 * What it does **not** do, and must be replaced before anything real depends
 * on it (M1, per-node keypairs):
 *
 * - one symmetric secret shared by every node — any holder can impersonate any
 *   other node, so `node` in the auth frame is an audit label, never authority;
 * - no rotation, no expiry, no revocation;
 * - connection-level only: individual envelopes are not authenticated, so an
 *   authenticated peer may claim any `from` (that is why the inbound adapter
 *   re-renders `from` itself, protocol.md rule E-1);
 * - no forward secrecy — confidentiality on the wire comes entirely from TLS.
 *
 * The secret itself is never a literal in this repository. It is supplied by
 * the caller, typically via {@link pskFromEnv}.
 *
 * ## The replacement, and why both live here at once
 *
 * P12.3 landed the successor described above: an Ed25519 signature by the
 * dialer's own node key, over the same tuple the MAC covers
 * (key-distribution.md §7.1), plus a signature *back* from the listener
 * (§7.1.1) — because "the peer could verify me" stopped implying "the peer
 * holds the secret too" the moment the proof became asymmetric.
 *
 * The two coexist inside frame version 1 rather than one replacing the other,
 * and that is forced rather than chosen: `frames.ts` compares `v` for strict
 * equality, so a version bump produces two generations that cannot talk at
 * all. Migration therefore rides on an optional field, and this module's job
 * is to decide which proof a given auth frame is offering. See §8.2 for the
 * three phases — this package implements the first two; only `required` on
 * {@link ListenerIdentity} moves a deployment to the third.

 * under that name rather than under the name on the frame is the whole point:
 * it is what turns a tampered `AgentRecord.endpoint` from a successful
 * redirect into a failed connection (§11 T-B′). A listener that answers with
 * a different name than the dialer asked for is refused before any signature
 * is even checked — the name is the claim being tested.
 *
 * An unsigned ready is opportunistically authenticated only: it is accepted
 * during the coexistence phase, but it has fallen back to PSK and must be
 * recorded as such. Pinning the peer (or enabling the strict deployment
 * stage) refuses that fallback, including when an on-path actor stripped the
 * optional fields.

/**
 * Whether this verifier takes up a credential the peer offered, or judges the
 * frame as the plainly signed one it also is.
 *
 * The question asked here is **"can this verifier form an opinion about
 * credentials at all"**, deliberately *not* "did this particular credential
 * resolve". Those are one keystroke apart and opposite in consequence, so the
 * two answers are worth spelling out:
 *
 * - **No credential directory** (a `--trust`-only listener, §8.2 phase ①). It
 *   holds no view on credentials whatsoever — it cannot admit one, revoke one,
 *   or tell them apart — so a credential-bearing frame carries, for this
 *   verifier, exactly the information a legacy signed frame carries: an
 *   Ed25519 signature over the five-element tuple, checkable against the key
 *   it was handed by hand. Reading it that way is what makes phase ① mean what
 *   §8.2 says it means. The alternative — the behaviour this replaces — is
 *   that the first node to gain a certificate silently loses every peer that
 *   has not gained one yet, `unknown_signer` on a key the listener is holding.
 * - **A credential directory that returned `null`** (unknown selector, or a
 *   certificate on the revocation list). Falling back here would be a
 *   **revocation bypass**: the holder of a revoked certificate whose bare
 *   public key still sits in somebody's `--trust` list would get back in by
 *   offering a credential that does not resolve — turning "send garbage" into
 *   a downgrade primitive, and making §6.4's revocation depend on the peer's
 *   good manners. So that case does not reach this function: it resolves
 *   through the credential path and is refused as {@link
 *   HandshakeRejection.UnknownSigner}, exactly as before.
 *
 * `credentialProofRequired` keeps its veto on top of the first case. A verifier
 * that demands the exact proof and cannot check one refuses rather than
 * downgrades — policy that quietly evaporates when the directory is the wrong
 * shape is not policy.
 *
 * This adds no downgrade surface. An on-path actor may already strip
 * `credential`/`credentialProof` from a v1 frame without disturbing `sig`
 * (§7.1, "混版本事实"), and against a directory-less verifier that already
 * lands on the legacy path today. The fallback reaches the same verdict for
 * the honest frame that the stripped one already reaches; what changes is only
 * that the honest peer no longer has to be attacked in order to connect.
