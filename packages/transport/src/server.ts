 * out (`WebSocketTransport.ts:163` / `:180`) and none of them accepts. A node
 * that other nodes can send to needs the other side of that connection, and
 * this file is it.
 *
 * Responsibilities, in the order a byte meets them: accept, challenge, verify
 * the dialer's proof — an Ed25519 signature where one is offered and this node
 * has the material to check it, the pre-shared key otherwise (`handshake.ts`)
 * — validate the envelope, dedup it, hand it to the node, and answer with a
 * receipt. Anything before the handshake completes is answered with a close
 * code, never with an error body — an unauthenticated peer learns nothing from
 * us, including *which* of the ways to fail it found.
 *
 * A receipt is **not** the protocol's `ack` (see `frames.ts`): it means this
 * node has taken the envelope in, and the acknowledgement that the target
 * agent actually read it belongs to `@qianmo/adapter`, one layer up.
