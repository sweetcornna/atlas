/**
 * A listener whose certificate lapses (key-distribution.md §6.3) — DoD 7.
 *
 * The rule exists because a TLS session is settled at handshake time: an
 * expired — or revoked — certificate keeps serving every connection made
 * before it lapsed, for as long as that connection happens to live, and on a
 * long-lived node link that is indefinitely. So the node closes them itself,
 * with 4003, rather than waiting for the peer to notice.
 *
 * Over a unix socket, deliberately. What is being tested is the *rule*, which
 * is a decision about a `notAfter` timestamp; wrapping it in real TLS would
 * add a second thing that could fail without adding a thing being checked.
