/**
 * A reconnect re-reads the TLS materials from disk (key-distribution.md §6.3
 * rule 4) — P12.3's fourth handover item.
 *
 * §6.3 rules 1–3 are about *live* connections, and they are already right: a
 * TLS session is fixed at handshake time, so swapping a file changes nothing
 * until the link drops. Rule 4 is the other half, and it is the one that bites
 * quietly — a client object holding the PEM string it was constructed with
 * keeps re-presenting it "拿着已换掉的旧证书重连到死", long after the operator
 * swapped the file and considered the rotation finished. Nothing goes red; the
 * node simply stops being able to connect once the old certificate expires.
 *
 * ## Where the observation point has to be, and why
 *
 * The obvious test — rotate the *client's* certificate and let the listener
 * notice — cannot be written on Bun 1.3.13. F-8: a listener can read no peer
 * certificate at all, and the 2026-08-19 addendum: it does not even check the
 * one it is handed against `ca`. There is no server-side observation of which
 * client certificate arrived.
 *
 * So the rotation is done on the half that *is* wire-observable. The dialer
 * does check the listener's chain (same addendum), so: rotate the CA root on
 * disk together with the listener's leaf, drop the link, and a client that
 * re-reads reconnects while a client holding the old root cannot. That is the
 * same mechanism under test, measured where Bun lets it be measured.
