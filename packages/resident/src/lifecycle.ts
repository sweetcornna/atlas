/**
 * Termination-cause forensics, in one small file (design §3.B2, hermes B2).
 *
 * The node stamps `running` when it comes up and `stopped` when it goes down
 * through its own shutdown path. Anything that leaves `running` behind killed
 * it from the outside. Cost is two writes per life plus a 30 s heartbeat;
 * the value is that "was the last death a kill?" stops being a research task.
 *
 * ## What this mechanism deliberately does not do
 *
 * - **It does not say *why* it was killed.** OOM, SIGKILL from an operator and
 *   a host reboot all read as `killed`. Distinguishing them needs the kernel's
 *   side of the story (`dmesg`, journald), which a file written by the victim
 *   cannot have. Claiming otherwise would be a guess wearing evidence's
 *   clothes.
 * - **It does not gate anything.** No start is refused, no backoff is extended,
 *   nothing branches on the verdict. It is evidence, and B8 says evidence never
 *   changes behaviour — the restart-storm breaker that *does* change behaviour
 *   is the admission ledger's, keyed on the message that caused the crash
 *   rather than on the fact that a crash happened.
 * - **It does not survive a config-directory wipe**, and it is per config
 *   directory, not per host: two residents sharing one config directory would
 *   overwrite each other. They already cannot (`sessions.json` has the same
 *   shape), so this adds no new constraint.
 * - **It never throws.** Every path is fail-open: a sentinel that cannot be
 *   written must not be able to stop a node from serving.
