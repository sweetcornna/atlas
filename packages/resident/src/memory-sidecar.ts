/**
 * Memory recall as a **user-message sidecar** (design `resident-botization.md`
 * §4.4, hermes D3/D5).
 *
 * WHERE THE INJECTION GOES, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE SYSTEM PROMPT
 *
 * The block this module renders is appended to the text of the turn's user
 * message — the same string `formatTeammateMessages` produced — and never to
 * the system prompt. Three reasons, in the order they matter:
 *
 *   1. it is the one dynamic channel that sits *after* the cached prefix, so a
 *      block that changes every turn costs nothing;
 *   2. putting it in the system prompt would rebuild that prompt every turn,
 *      which throws away the whole prefix cache on every single wake — in a
 *      watch job that runs for seven days straight that is pure loss;
 *   3. memory is evidence, not instruction. It belongs where the rest of the
 *      turn's evidence is.
 *
 * WHY THE RECALL IS A FROZEN SNAPSHOT
 *
 * `recall()` runs exactly once per turn, at the moment the reader builds the
 * prompt, and the rendered string is then written into the admission ledger
 * alongside the prompt (`DetectedAdmissionRecord.prompt`). Every later step of
 * that turn — every tool call, every model round trip, and every post-crash
 * recovery — replays that stored string. It is *structurally* impossible for a
 * memory write made mid-turn to change what this turn is looking at.
 *
 * This is deliberate and must not be "optimised" into a live read. A turn whose
 * evidence changes under it while it reasons cannot be reproduced, cannot be
 * audited, and can cite an entry that was not in front of it when it decided.
 * AC-4 asks the answer to carry the id and the write time of what it used; that
 * promise only holds if "what it used" is a fixed set.
 *
 * WHY THE SCOPE IS `(agent, contextId)`
 *
 * The same key the ACP session is chosen by (§4.3). A watch job and a human
 * conversation with the same node are different contexts, so they are different
 * memory partitions — no configuration, no opt-in, and nothing to get wrong.

 * store, and every entry in it is injected as though the node had written it.

 * interpreted relative to CWD". This is that rule, applied to the one root the
