/**
 * The ceiling on what an unattended turn may do (design
 * `resident-botization.md` §4.5, hermes E2 / E3 / E5).
 *
 * WHAT THE RISK ACTUALLY IS
 *
 * The premise this batch inherited — "a resident node is a permanent yolo" —
 * is false, and the correction matters because it changes what has to be
 * built. A resident session runs with `permissionMode: 'dontAsk'`, whose base
 * semantics are *don't prompt, deny if not pre-approved*, and that conversion
 * is deliberately placed at the very end of the permission chain so an early
 * return cannot route around it. `requestPermission` is then hard-wired to
 * `cancelled` on top of that. Nothing is being waved through.
 *
 * What is missing is a **ceiling on pre-approval**. One `allow` rule in a
 * `settings.json` — or one `PreToolUse` hook that answers `allow` — can permit
 * anything at all, including editing that same `settings.json`, reading the
 * node's identity key, or truncating the audit trail that would have recorded
 * it. So the thing to build is not a brake on yolo; it is a list of targets no
 * pre-approval reaches, evaluated **before** any allow rule is consulted.
 *
 * TWO PROPERTIES, BOTH LOAD-BEARING
 *
 * **It is evaluated before allow.** The wrapper in
 * `src/services/qianmo/residentGuard.ts` runs this table inside each tool's
 * `checkPermissions`, which the base consults at step 1c — ahead of the
 * bypass-permissions mode (2a), ahead of the whole-tool allow rule (2b), and
 * ahead of the path where a `PreToolUse` hook already answered `allow` and only
 * rule-based objections still apply. A deny returned there is final.
 *
 * **It is not read from session configuration.** The table below is a frozen
 * literal in this package. It has no settings reader, no environment lookup and
 * no constructor parameter that can empty it — the only injected values are
 * absolute state roots, which *add* coverage and cannot remove any. A hardline
 * list that a session could edit would be protecting the file that edits it.
 *
 * ON THE SHELL HALF
 *
 * Blocking the file tools alone is what hermes calls unpaired theatre: `Bash`
 * can `cat`, `tee`, `sed -i` and `rm` every one of these targets. So the same
 * table is applied to command strings, over every path-shaped token in them.
 *
 * The honest limit: a determined command can obscure a path from any lexical
 * matcher (`$(printf 'admission')`, a variable assembled at runtime, a copy
 * made under another name first). This is a ceiling on pre-approval, not a
 * sandbox — the sandbox is a separate, coarser mechanism and stays the thing
 * that contains a genuinely hostile command. What this does guarantee is that
 * no *rule* and no *hook* can hand out access to these paths, and that the
 * ordinary ways of reaching them are refused on both surfaces rather than one.
