/**
 * The node's idle/active telemetry link to the host that keeps its sandbox
 * from being frozen.
 *
 * ## Why this dial is **not** signed (key-distribution.md §7.1.1)
 *
 * Every other outbound `TransportClient` in this tree gained a `signing`
 * identity in P12.4. This one deliberately did not, and the reason is that
 * there is no second node to check a signature against:
 * `startResidentActivityServer` (`@qianmo/activator`) is a per-node listener
 * on the **host** side, and it authenticates by requiring that the dialer,
 * the sender address and the destination address all be this very node
 * (`context.peerNode !== options.node` is a refusal there). It has no
 * Ed25519 identity of its own — to counter-sign a ready frame under this
 * node's segment it would have to hold this node's *private* key, which is
 * precisely the thing `nodeIdentity.ts` exists to keep on one machine.
 *
 * §7.1.1's guarantee is a statement about two distinct node identities; here
 * there is one, so the mutual half cannot be constructed rather than merely
 * being unimplemented. `TransportClient` says the same thing from its side by
 * refusing `signing` without a `peerNode`, and there is no honest `peerNode`
 * to give it. The link is loopback or a unix socket in every deployed shape,
 * and its whole payload is one boolean.
