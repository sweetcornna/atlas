/**
 * Rule H-2, as something that fails a build rather than something a reviewer
 * remembers: **a resident node never opens a connection to a peer.**
 *
 * Every answer it owes — a `task.result`, a redelivery, a `notify` — leaves on
 * the reverse direction of a channel the *peer* established. That is the
 * property the whole watch-job shape stands on: the design's alternative
 * ("give the resident a `--registry` and let it dial the hub") was rejected
 * precisely because it turns a node that is only ever reachable into a node
 * that is also a client, and the sandbox freeze semantics R-3 relies on stop
 * being expressible the moment that happens.
 *
 * ## Why a scan and not a unit test
 *
 * The unit tests next door prove the notifier does not dial. They cannot prove
 * that *nothing else* starts to: the next batch to add an outbound path would
 * add it somewhere these tests never look, and every one of them would stay
 * green. So this file reads the resident's source instead, and the allowlist
 * below is the complete, deliberate list of places a connection is opened.
 *
 * The one entry on it is not a peer link. `ResidentActivityReporter` dials the
 * process **supervising this sandbox** to report busy/idle — inside the
 * sandbox boundary, to the host that started it, carrying no task and no
 * peer's traffic. H-2 is about the network; that link is about staying awake.
 * Anything else appearing here needs the same paragraph written for it, in the
 * PR, before this list is edited.
