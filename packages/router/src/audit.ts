/**
 * The routing layer's audit trail.
 *
 * AC-3 does not ask merely that a loop be cut — it asks that cutting it leave
 * **one event carrying the whole message chain**. A cut that vanishes is
 * indistinguishable from a message that was never sent, which is exactly the
 * failure mode an operator cannot debug. So the chain fields are assembled in
 * one place ({@link chainDetail}) rather than at each call site: a detail that
 * omits `traceId` would satisfy a reviewer reading the code and fail the
 * acceptance criterion reading the log.
 *
 * ## Why three event types and not one with a `layer` field
 *
 * Charter AC-3 requires the two rate-limiting layers to be verified
 * independently and says in as many words that they must not be conflated. A
 * single `rate_limited` event with a `layer: 'runtime' | 'protocol'` field
 * would put both under one counter, and every question afterwards ("did the
 * protocol budget ever trip?") would depend on remembering to filter. Separate
 * types make the wrong query impossible rather than merely discouraged:
 *
 * | type                | layer    | in protocol.md §8 state machine? |
 * |---------------------|----------|----------------------------------|
 * | `loop_detected`     | protocol | yes — terminal state             |
 * | `rate_limited`      | protocol | yes — terminal state             |
 * | `runtime_throttled` | runtime  | **no**, by §6.4                  |
