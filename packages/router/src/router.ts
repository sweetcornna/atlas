/**
 * The routing layer's two gates, as one per-node object.
 *
 * Everything a node has to decide about a message *besides* what it says lives
 * here: has this handler already been asked to do this task, has this hop count
 * run away, has this peer used up its inbound budget, may we send one more
 * message to this address. `@qianmo/transport` states in its own header that it
 * carries none of this, `@qianmo/adapter` states that these steps slot in ahead
 * of its mailbox write, and `@qianmo/activator` states that it does no loop
 * detection or rate accounting. This is the package all three point at.
 *
 * ## One object per node, both directions
 *
 * The loop table is shared between the two faces on purpose. Outbound seeding
 * writes the originating handler into it (D-2's second defect: the origin does
 * not seed itself); inbound admission reads it. Split them into two objects and
 * A→B→A stops being detectable at A on the first return — which is precisely
 * what AC-3 constructs.
 *
 * ## Ordering inside `inbound`
 *
 * Hop backstop, then loop, then the inbound budget. The loop check runs ahead
 * of the budget because a message that is a loop must be *reported as a loop*:
 * if a flood put the budget first, the one event AC-3 asks for would be
 * replaced by a rate rejection, and the operator would learn that a peer was
 * noisy but not that traffic was circling. The table is bounded, so the loop
 * check cannot itself become the amplifier that ordering usually guards
 * against.
 *
 * ## The two clocks
 *
 * Loop entries are judged on the **gated** clock when the host supplies one
 * (rule T-2): a node that just thawed must not prune the table in the same
 * instant its gated deadline check is still admitting the messages those
 * entries protect. A host with no gate to offer falls back to the raw clock and
 * accepts a short window after a thaw in which a loop reads as fresh traffic —
 * `activator/src/node.ts` says which side of that line it is on.
 *
 * Rate buckets are judged on the raw clock either way: a freeze really did
 * consume wall time, and a bucket that refused to refill across it would punish
 * a node for having been asleep.
