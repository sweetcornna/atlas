/**
 * What an on-demand tunnel is in M0, stated before anything is built.
 *
 * **It is not a new encryption layer.** Charter N-3 keeps M0 on TLS plus a
 * pre-shared key and says so as a limitation; inventing a second crypto scheme
 * here would be both out of scope and worse than the one we have. What "按需
 * 加密隧道" actually buys is in the first two words: the connection **exists
 * only while a lease does**. Before the negotiation there is nothing listening;
 * after the lease ends there is nothing listening, no channel retained, and no
 * copy of the credential anywhere in the process.
 *
 * So a tunnel is exactly three things on top of `@qianmo/transport`:
 *
 * 1. a listener opened **after** a lease exists and bound to it;
 * 2. an admission check on the first message: the borrower must present the
 *    capability the lender itself minted (rule S-1 makes that check meaningful
 *    — only this node could have signed it);
 * 3. **three teardown paths, none of which need the peer to cooperate**:
 *    normal release, lease expiry, and the peer disappearing.
 *
 * The third is why reconnect is off. `@qianmo/transport`'s client reconnects by
 * default, which is right for a node link and exactly wrong here: a tunnel that
 * comes back after the borrower died is a tunnel that outlives its lease.
