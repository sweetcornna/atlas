/**
 * The lender's half: a listener that exists only while a lease does.
 *
 * ## The three teardown paths, and why each is real
 *
 * | path | trigger | who has to cooperate |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | released | the borrower says it is done | the borrower — but see below |
 * | expired | the lease's own deadline | nobody |
 * | peer-lost | the socket closed, or went silent past the idle window | nobody |
 *
 * The last two exist because the first cannot be relied on. A borrower that
 * crashes mid-task never sends a release, and a tunnel that waited for one
 * would be a lease that never ends — which is the failure charter AC-7's sixth
 * beat is about. So the deadline runs on the lender's own clock, and the
 * transport's disconnect callback tears down immediately.
 *
 * ## What "no residue" means here, precisely
 *
 * After teardown: the server is stopped (a later dial gets a connection error,
 * which the tests assert rather than assume), no logical channel is retained
 * for the peer to come back to (`channelRetentionMs: 0`), and the capability
 * this host was checking against is dropped. The token is held in one field of
 * one object and that object is released — this is a garbage-collected runtime,
 * so "wiped from memory" is not something this file can honestly promise, and
 * it does not.
