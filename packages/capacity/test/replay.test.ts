/**
 * P6.2's DoD, as two replays.
 *
 * 1. **Lead time.** Replay a contest history against the seeded calendar and
 *    show the scale-up landing at least 30 minutes before the load.
 * 2. **False positives.** Replay flat load with nothing on the calendar and
 *    show at most one trigger per seven days.
 *
 * ## Why the flat replay warms up for two weeks first
 *
 * The baseline is keyed on slot of week, so a slot gains one observation per
 * week. A planner fed exactly seven cold days has *no* same-slot history at any
 * point, abstains from the deviation path throughout, and scores a perfect zero
 * — a number that says nothing about the detector because the detector never
 * ran. So each seed gets three weeks: two to learn from, and the seventh day
 * onward — **the seven days the DoD is about** — scored with the detector fully
 * armed. `the detector really was armed` below is the case that proves the
 * warm-up did its job rather than merely delaying the abstention.
