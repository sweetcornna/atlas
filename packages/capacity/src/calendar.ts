 * ramp, and arithmetic on the two. The lead time it produces comes from the
 * calendar entry itself. Nothing here estimates when a contest will happen, and
 * the honest description of the mechanism is *read the calendar and start
 * early* — see the package header for why that distinction is written down
 * rather than left to the reader.
 *
 * ## The seed data is a modelling assumption
 *
 * `CUMCM_2026` below carries plausible dates and a plausible ramp. They are
 * **not** an authoritative schedule: the official one is published each year by
 * the organising committee and the numbers here have not been checked against
 * it. Anything that needs the real dates loads them through
 * {@link calendarFromEntries}; the seed exists so the replay tests have a window
 * to aim at.
