/**
 * When this node decides it will need more room, and how loudly it has to be
 * convinced.
 *
 * ## Why none of these belong in `LIMITS`
 *
 * `@qianmo/protocol`'s `LIMITS` is the set of numbers **every node has to agree
 * on** — envelope size, hop count, TTLs — because disagreeing about them
 * corrupts the wire. `@qianmo/negotiation`'s `policy.ts` already argued the
 * general case for keeping a local ceiling out of it: how much *this* machine
 * will lend differs per deployment and is nobody else's business.
 *
 * The case here is a step stronger than negotiation's. Negotiation at least
 * carries `ResourceNeed` **fields** on the wire, so part of it had to live in
 * the protocol. Nothing in this file reaches a wire at all: no message carries
 * a z-score, no peer can read a cooldown, and two nodes running different
 * `zScore` values interoperate perfectly and always will. Promoting these to
 * `LIMITS` would make a local tuning knob into a network-wide constant that
 * needs a charter amendment to turn (protocol.md §12.2 A), in exchange for
 * nothing.
 *
 * ## What the numbers are, and how hard it is to trip them
 *
 * The default is deliberately hard to trip: three consecutive buckets, four
 * robust deviations, **and** half again the slot's median. The DoD's budget is
 * one false positive per seven days of replay, and a detector that fires on any
 * one of those three would spend it before Tuesday.
