/**
 * `@qianmo/capacity` — deciding to scale up before the load arrives (P6.2).
 *
 * Two paths, and the difference between them matters more than either.
 *
 * **Path A reads a calendar.** The lead time it produces — the thirty-plus
 * minutes P6.2's DoD asks for — comes from `rampBeforeMs` on a calendar entry
 * a human typed in. There is no forecast, no extrapolation and no learned
 * arrival time: the mechanism is *read the calendar, subtract the ramp, act
 * early*, and arithmetic on a date is all it is. This is written down here
 * because "predictive scaling" is exactly the phrase that invites a reader — or
 * a slide — to hear "a model predicted the peak". It did not. Charter §5.8's
 * discipline about what we claim applies to our own capabilities, not only to
 * the base's provenance: the honest description of path A is the one above, and
 * it is the one to use externally.
 *
 * **Path B reads history.** Median and MAD per slot of the week, a deviation
 * test with a ratio floor, and a run-length requirement. Also not a model: no
 * training, no weights, no inference, and the same input gives the same output
 * on any machine. AC-5's model-neutrality and the auditability the whole trail
 * rests on both want it that way — a decision an operator cannot re-derive by
 * hand is a decision they cannot argue with.
 *
 * **Nothing here provisions anything.** Charter N-7 keeps real elastic capacity
 * out of M0; a decision's whole effect is a line in the audit trail. See
 * `executor.ts` for where the other half will attach.
