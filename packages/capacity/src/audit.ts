/**
 * What the planner writes down, and why the suppressed ones are written too.
 *
 * P6.2's DoD has two halves and this file serves both. "Triggered ≥ 30 min
 * before the peak" is answered by `leadMs` on a `Predicted` event — one scalar,
 * on the record, so the claim is checkable from the trail alone rather than by
 * re-deriving it from a window id. "Does not fire on flat load" is answered by
 * the *absence* of `Predicted` and `Reactive` events, which is only a
 * meaningful absence if the near misses are visible: hence `Suppressed`.
 *
 * A suppressed decision is not a refusal. Nobody turned it down — the planner
 * had already acted on the same rise, or the cooldown from the last one had not
 * lapsed. That distinction is why the P7.2 wiring files these as `dropped`.
 *
 * Details are scalars only, in the same shape as every other layer's ring, so
 * they can go through the trail's translation unchanged.
