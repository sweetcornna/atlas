/**
 * Usage, as the planner sees it: fixed-width buckets over the audit trail.
 *
 * ## Why a structural subset rather than `import type { AuditRecord }`
 *
 * The three fields read here — `at`, `kind`, `taskId` — arrive from the P7.2
 * trail on disk, from a layer's own in-memory ring, and (in the tests) from a
 * generator that never touched an audit log at all. Typing against
 * `@qianmo/audit`'s record would force all three to pretend to be a trail line,
 * and would put a dependency edge between two packages that have no business
 * knowing about each other. `@qianmo/diagnosis`'s `TaskResultLike` set the
 * precedent for exactly this situation; this is the same move.
 *
 * ## The three numbers, and which one the planner actually watches
 *
 * A bucket carries three counts because three different questions get asked of
 * a usage history later. Only one of them is load in the sense capacity is
 * bought for — see {@link loadOf}.
