/**
 * What happens to a decision — which in M0 is: it gets written down.
 *
 * ## The blank here is on purpose, and this is where it is
 *
 * Charter N-7 puts real elastic provisioning out of M0's scope: no cloud API,
 * no instance claim, no billing linkage. So `ScaleUpExecutor` is a one-method
 * seam with exactly one implementation — {@link auditOnlyExecutor} — and
 * nothing in the product wires a second one. P7.2's trail sinks left the same
 * kind of gap in the same way: the translation exists and is tested, the
 * production call site is a later task's.
 *
 * Stating it plainly so a reader does not go looking for the missing half:
 * **this is a blank, not an omission.** M2+ replaces `auditOnlyExecutor` with
 * something that talks to `@qianmo/negotiation` (borrow a machine that already
 * exists) or to a provisioning API (M2's job). Nothing above this file changes
 * when that happens.
 *
 * ## Why `needFromDecision` is a free function
 *
 * "How much" is a pure function of the decision and nothing else — no clock, no
 * inventory, no I/O — so it is testable on its own and reusable by an executor
 * that does not exist yet. It is also the only place a policy number is turned
 * into a resource number, which is where a reviewer would look for it.
