/**
 * The `read`-flip observer (protocol.md §4.5).
 *
 * ## Why an ack may not be sent when the file write returns
 *
 * The base enforces its mailbox quota **by dropping messages, unread ones
 * included**. Every write compacts first
 * (`src/utils/agents/teammateMailbox.ts:271-279`), keeping in three tiers —
 * unread protocol, unread ordinary, read — and simply stops keeping once
 * `MAX_MAILBOX_RETAINED_BYTES` is reached (`:198-248`). Everything squeezed
 * out leaves a single `logError` behind (`:250-269`); the sender is told
 * nothing.
 *
 * An ack emitted at write time would therefore report an evicted message as
 * delivered, and the failure would surface to the sender as "the ack arrived,
 * the result never did" — precisely the shape that costs AC-2 its 10/10.
 *
 * ## What the flip means
 *
 * `read` flipping to `true` is, in both of the base's delivery shapes, exactly
 * "the message has entered the target agent's input":
 *
 * - in-process teammate: `markMessageAsReadByIdentity`
 *   (`src/utils/swarm/inProcessRunner.ts:854-858`), immediately before
 *   `msg.text` is handed back to the agent loop as the next prompt (`:859-865`);
 * - attachment delivery: `markMessagesAsReadBySnapshot`
 *   (`src/utils/attachments/team.ts:192-197`), deliberately placed *after* the
 *   attachment is built so no step can lose the message (`:181-188`).
 *
 * That is the A-class assertion, no more and no less.
 *
 * ## Mechanism
 *
 * Polling, not `fs.watch`: every mailbox write is a temp-file + `rename`
 * (`teammateMailbox.ts:166-169`) so a watcher *would* see each change, but
 * `fs.watch` behaviour under gVisor and across freeze/thaw is unverified
 * (protocol.md §12.3.2). The protocol therefore fixes the semantics and
 * leaves the mechanism open, with one constraint: the observation period must
 * not exceed the base's own polling period for the shape in use, or it merely
 * adds a base period of latency.

/**
 * Watch one mailbox entry until it reaches a terminal state.
 *
 * ## The time-jump gate (rule T-2, §5.3)
 *
 * E4 measured `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` advancing normally while a sandbox is frozen,
 * and `setInterval` not making up missed ticks — a 34.7 s gap produced one
 * tick. Without a gate, a node that just thawed would find every in-flight
 * deadline crossed at the same instant and declare all of them expired.
 *
 * So: a tick separated from its predecessor by more than `2 × period` is taken
 * as evidence that this node was frozen, and the whole observed gap is added
 * back to the deadline instead of being charged to the delivery budget. That
 * is also why `LIMITS.defaultTtlMs` does not need to grow to cover working-set
 * warm-up: warm-up happens on the target's side of the gate.
 *
 * Note that this function does not catch read failures. A mailbox holding an
 * oversized entry throws on *every* read (`teammateMailbox.ts:96-136`,
 * `:326-335`), and the rejection propagates rather than being folded into a
 * terminal state — the caller has to see a poisoned mailbox, not mistake it
 * for an eviction. The blob staging area exists so this node never creates
 * that condition itself.
