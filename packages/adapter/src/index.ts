/**
 * `@qianmo/adapter` — the last hop of a cross-node delivery.
 *
 * Three parts, all of protocol.md §4.5 and §9:
 *
 * 1. the **inbound adapter**, which calls `teammateMailbox.writeToMailbox`
 *    directly and never routes through `SendMessageTool`;
 * 2. the **`read`-flip observer**, which turns "the agent actually took the
 *    message in" into one of three terminal states, so an ack is never emitted
 *    merely because a file write returned;
 * 3. the **blob staging area**, which keeps an oversized payload out of the
 *    base mailbox's 64 KiB read/write invariant.
 *
 * This package only ever calls *into* the base (rule M-6): nothing in the base
 * calls back, which is what keeps the dependency acyclic.
