 * things follow from that, and both are the reason the rule exists
 * (`CLAUDE.md` §1.1②):
 *
 *   - The config root is identity-scoped: `~/.occ` normally, `~/.qianmo` under
 *     `OCC_IDENTITY=qianmo`, and either overridable via `OCC_CONFIG_DIR` /
 *     `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`. A literal `join(homedir(), '.occ')` would resolve to
 *     one fixed directory and punch straight through the isolation a Qianmo
 *     node depends on.
 *   - `getMemoryBaseDir()` additionally honours `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE_MEMORY_DIR`,
 *     which is how a remote/sandboxed deployment redirects memory onto a
 *     persistent mount. For a resident node whose sandbox can be reset that is
 *     not a nicety: memory that ignored it would not survive a wake.
 *
 * The result is a sibling of the base's own `projects/<slug>/memory/` tree, not
 * a location inside it — see `mapping.ts` §2 for why that separation is load
 * bearing.
