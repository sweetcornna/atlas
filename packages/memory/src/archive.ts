 * 沉淀归档 — the working → project half of the two motions charter §1.5 puts
 * across the layers ("沉淀归档" downward-to-upward, "检索唤醒" back down).
 *
 * A task ends, and its working memory has to stop existing as working memory:
 * charter §1.5 gives that layer a task-level lifetime and exactly two exits,
 * 沉淀 or 丢弃. This function performs both, and it performs them as *marks* —
 * every working entry it touches is still on disk afterwards, retired with a
 * kind and a reason, because "the task is over" is not a licence to destroy the
 * record of what happened during it.
 *
 * The dual time axis does the real work in the promotion step. A promoted entry
 * is a new record in the project table, so its ingest axis starts now:
 * `createdAt` is the moment project memory learned it. Its event axis is
 * inherited untouched: `validAt` still points at the moment the fact became
 * true, back during the task. Cite the promoted entry and you get an honest
 * write time for the project record *and* an honest age for the fact. With one
 * timestamp you would have to lie about one of them.
