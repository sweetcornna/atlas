/**
 * What the store records about its own scans.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS — a scan and a lookup want opposite failure behaviour.
 *
 * The first cut of this package let every read throw. A file that had been
 * hand-edited under the memory root therefore took down `query()` entirely,
 * and with it every *healthy* record beside it. Measured, not predicted: three
 * good entries, one file replaced with `this is not valid frontmatter at all`,
 * and the recall for all three was gone. On the P3.3 wake path that is a
 * resident node coming back with no memory at all — a single bad byte
 * escalating into subsystem-wide failure, which is precisely the blast radius
 * AC-6 exists to bound.
 *
 * Swinging to the other extreme — swallow the failure, skip the file — is the
 * wrong repair for an audit store: the one event an audit exists to catch is
 * the record that quietly stopped being there. So neither. A scan returns
 * every record it *can* read and reports every record it *cannot*, on this
 * channel. A lookup by id keeps throwing, because the caller named that one
 * record and a `null` would read as "no such memory" — which would turn AC-4's
 * citation check into a false negative.
 *
 * The recorder is always present, with or without a caller-supplied sink.
 * A channel nobody is required to subscribe to is still a channel; a failure
 * with nowhere to be written down is silence.
 *
 * Nothing here may carry a secret. Detail values are meant to be printable.
