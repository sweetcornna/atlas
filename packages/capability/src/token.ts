 * Issuing and verifying capability tokens (protocol.md §10.1).
 *
 * ## The order of the checks, and why the nonce is last
 *
 * Structure, then binding (`aud` / `sub` / `taskId`), then the clock, then rule
 * S-1, then the signature, then the replay guard. Every step before the
 * signature is a rejection made on *unverified* claims, which is sound in one
 * direction only: refusing on an unverified claim costs an attacker a message,
 * while accepting on one would be the whole vulnerability.
 *
 * The nonce is consumed last, after the signature verifies, and that ordering
 * is the point rather than an optimization. Consume it earlier and anyone able
 * to guess a nonce could burn it with unsigned garbage, turning the replay
 * guard into a way to make the legitimate token bounce.
 *
 * ## Expiry is not gated by the time-jump rule
 *
 * Rule T-2 stops a thawed node from declaring every in-flight delivery dead at
 * once. It is deliberately **not** applied here: extending the life of an
 * authorization because the machine was asleep is the wrong direction of
 * failure. An expired token is expired; the sender can mint another, and the
 * cost of that is one round trip rather than an authorization that outlives its
 * own deadline by however long a freeze happened to last.
