/**
 * `@qianmo/diagnosis` — cause-level failure diagnosis (P5.1).
 *
 * Turns "the task failed" into one of five named causes with the evidence that
 * named it and the action it implies, or into an honest `unknown`. AC-7's
 * second beat is an operator reading the cause, so the output is a structured
 * event rather than a log line, and the rules are rules rather than a model —
 * see `classify.ts` for why that is a requirement here and not a preference.
 *
 * The classifier is the easy half. The hard half is the evidence: `exit 137`
 * cannot tell a timeout from an OOM, and no amount of pattern matching fixes
 * that. What fixes it is the runtime recording *which* of them it did at the
 * moment it did it, which `@qianmo/sandbox` already does — so this package
 * reads structured facts first and captured text second, always.
