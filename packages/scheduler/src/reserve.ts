/**
 * One-shot reservation arithmetic (hermes A6, design §4.1 point 2).
 *
 * Pure, and pure on purpose: this is the only file that decides *when*, and a
 * decision that can be re-derived by hand from three numbers is a decision an
 * operator can argue with when a fire looks wrong. Nothing here reads a clock,
 * touches a file, or knows that a node exists.
 *
 * ## What "one-shot" means and why there is no ticker
 *
 * The scheduler computes exactly one next instant, waits for it, fires, and
 * then computes the next one from what actually happened. It never keeps a
 * cadence running. On the hub that is a modest simplification; on a node it
 * would be the difference between the sleeping node charter R-3 describes and a
 * process that is awake every minute forever. The timing is on the hub *so
 * that* no node needs a ticker — see `job.ts`.
 *
 * ## Catch-up collapses; it does not replay
 *
 * A hub down for five periods comes back owing five scheduled instants. It
 * runs **one**. Replaying five would deliver five turns to one node in one
 * second — the node runs turns serially, so the other four would queue behind
 * the first and each would carry a `taskTtlMs` that started counting while it
 * queued. Four timed-out tasks and one useful answer is a worse outcome than
 * one useful answer, and it is a worse outcome *for the same work*.

/**
 * Grace floor and ceiling for a catch-up run, in ms.
 *
 * `clamp(everyMs / 2, 120_000, 7_200_000)` — hermes' three numbers, adopted
 * unchanged because the reason is unchanged. Half a period is the natural
 * scale: past it, the make-up run and the next scheduled run are closer to each
 * other than either is to its own slot. The floor keeps a fast job (say every
 * 60 s) from giving up on a hub restart that took ninety seconds, which is a
 * normal restart. The ceiling exists to stop a thundering herd: without it, a
 * daily job would carry a twelve-hour grace, so a hub that came back after a
 * long weekend would fire every job it owns inside the same second, at every
 * node it owns, all with real side effects.

 *
 * That last fallback deserves its own sentence, because it decides the

 * anchor and no first fire, every call to this function would re-anchor at the
 * current `now` and push the first instant one period further out, so the job
 * would never run at all. Firing once is what pins the grid; from the second
 * lap on the anchor is `lastFiredAt` and the schedule is exact.
 *
 * A job that wants a phase instead of an immediate run says so with `anchorMs`.
