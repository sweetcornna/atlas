 * it: a node that held its own schedule would need something to wake it on
 * time, and anything that wakes a node on a cadence is a node that is never

/**
 * Legal shape of a job id.
 *
 * Tighter than it looks like it needs to be, because the id is spent in two
 * places that have opinions:
 *
 * - It becomes the `contextId` of every task this job dispatches (§4.1 point
 *   3), and the resident side stores contexts verbatim only when they are
 *   printable and bounded — anything else gets digested into a hash, which
 *   would make the console's "which session is this job talking in" answer
 *   unreadable.
 * - It becomes a directory name under the claim store. An id containing a
 *   separator or a `..` would be a path traversal dressed up as a schedule
 *   entry, and the claim store is the one file the at-most-once property rests
 *   on.
 *
 * Rejecting at registration is cheap; discovering either problem at 3 a.m. on
 * the fire path is not.

/**
 * What the hub is allowed to do with a completed fire.
 *
 * **This package never reads this field.** It is validated here and carried to
 * the dispatch port, which owns the decision; the scheduler's business ends at
 * "the turn was dispatched". Stating that plainly because a policy enum that
 * the module holding it does not interpret looks like dead weight until someone
 * "tidies" it into the notify path and the two halves start disagreeing.
 *
 * - `silent` — the result reaches the audit trail and the console's job
 *   history and stops there. No `qianmo_notify` tool is injected, so the turn
 *   has no way to page anyone even if it decides it should.
 * - `agent-initiated` — the default posture of §4.1 point 5. The turn is given
 *   exactly one tool, `qianmo_notify`, and a human hears about the run only if
 *   the agent calls it. This is hermes' `[SILENT]` sentinel turned the right
 *   way round: default quiet with an explicit way to speak, rather than default
 *   loud with a magic string to suppress it.
 * - `always` — every completed fire notifies. Available because "tell me it
 *   ran" is a real request, deliberately not the default: a watch job that
 *   pages unconditionally is a cron job with extra latency, and seven days of
 *   it teaches its reader to ignore the channel.
