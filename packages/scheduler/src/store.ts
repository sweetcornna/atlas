/**
 * Durable scheduler state: one claim per `(jobId, fireAtMs)`, one state file.
 *
 * ## Why `wx` is the primitive
 *
 * `openSync(path, 'wx')` — `O_CREAT | O_EXCL` — is the only cross-process
 * atomic test-and-set POSIX hands out without a lock daemon. The kernel decides
 * the winner inside the syscall: exactly one caller gets a file descriptor,
 * every other caller gets `EEXIST`, and no interleaving of the two processes
 * changes that. There is no window between the test and the set because there
 * is no test.
 *
 * Everything else that looks like it would work does not:
 *
 * - `existsSync(path)` then write is a **TOCTOU race**, and the race window is
 *   the whole point. Two processes both see "no claim", both write, both fire.
 * - An in-memory `Set` is not a CAS at all. It is correct for exactly one
 *   process and answers "no one has claimed this" with perfect confidence
 *   about a question it cannot see the other half of.
 * - Advisory locks (`flock`) answer a different question — "who may proceed
 *   now" — and release on process death, which is the opposite of what a
 *   claim needs.
 *
 * And the scenario is not theoretical. Roadmap F7 names it: **an operator
 * starts a second `qm console`.** That is a thing operators do, on purpose,
 * while debugging, and the machine has no way to tell them not to. What it can
 * do is make the second one lose every race it enters.
 *
 * ## A claim is a tombstone, not a lock
 *
 * It is never released. A dispatch that fails does **not** free its claim, and
 * that is the at-most-once property doing its job: the retry for a failed fire
 * is the next scheduled instant, held back by `backoff.ts` — a different
 * `fireAtMs`, therefore a different key. Releasing on failure would turn
 * at-most-once into at-least-once at exactly the moment the target is already
 * struggling.
 *
 * Because it is not a lock it needs no lease, and because it needs no lease it
 * needs no agreement about the clock between two hubs. That is worth more than
 * the crash-recovery a lease would buy: a hub that dies mid-dispatch leaves a
 * slot unrun, which the next scheduled instant covers, whereas a lease that
 * expires under a *slow* dispatch delivers the turn twice.
 *
 * ## The state file is memory; the claim file is the promise
 *
 * Two hubs sharing this directory share `state.json`, and writes to it are
 * last-writer-wins. That is tolerable only because at-most-once does not rest
 * on it: the worst a lost state write can do is make a hub forget when a job
 * last ran, and the claim file then refuses the make-up run that forgetting
 * would otherwise cause. Anything whose correctness *does* depend on two hubs
 * agreeing belongs in a claim, not in here.
 *
 * ## Fail-open, and why this is not the admission ledger
 *
 * `@qianmo/resident`'s admission ledger fails **closed** on damage: a torn
 * record there means a message this node promised to read may be lost, and
 * refusing to continue is the right answer. This store is on the other side of
 * that line, per roadmap P13.5's rule for the reliability kit. A corrupt state
 * file here costs one job's memory of when it last ran — a duplicate-suppressed
 * make-up run, at worst. Refusing to start would turn "one watch job is
 * confused" into "no watch job runs", which is a strictly larger outage caused
 * entirely by the safety mechanism.
 *
 * Fail-open is not fail-silent. Every damaged read and every failed write goes
 * to `onError`; §4.1 point 6 requires a scheduler's absence to be *visible*,
 * and a store that swallowed its own faults would be the quietest way to be
 * absent.
