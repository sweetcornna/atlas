/**
 * The runner: what turns a plan into a dispatch, and nothing else.
 *
 * ## This module never dials a node
 *
 * `dispatch` is an injected port and the whole of this package's contact with
 * the network is calling it. The runner hands over `{ job, fireAtMs, dedupKey,
 * attempt }`; the **host** builds the `task.request` envelope from that, and
 * only the host does, for two reasons that pull the same way:
 *
 * - Building an envelope means knowing about `@qianmo/protocol` message shapes,
 *   `@qianmo/transport` connections, node identity and PSKs. A scheduler that
 *   knew all of those could not be tested without a network, and the schedule
 *   arithmetic — the part that is actually hard — is what would stop being
 *   testable.
 * - The two protocol facts this deliverable turns on are *inputs* to that
 *   envelope, not outputs of it: `contextId = job.id` (§4.1 point 3, which is
 *   what keeps a watch job's seven days of context out of a human's
 *   conversation) and `taskTtlMs = job.taskTtlMs` (§4.1 point 4, not
 *   `LIMITS.defaultTaskTtlMs`). They travel in the dispatch input where the
 *   host cannot help but see them.
 *
 * ## There is no ticker here either
 *
 * `start()` arms **one** `setTimeout`, and the next one is armed only after a
 * run completes — the same discipline as `@qianmo/resident`'s poller, which
 * reschedules from completion and never replays missed ticks. `runDue(now)` is
 * public and is what the tests drive: no test in this package waits on a real
 * timer, because a scheduler whose tests take as long as its schedule is a
 * scheduler nobody will change.
 *
 * ## Absence is the failure mode this design chose
 *
 * Moving the timing to the hub (§4.1) means the hub is a single point for it —
 * design §3.A row A7 records that as a deliberate divergence, since the
 * alternative fallback, a ticker inside the node, would undo the freeze that
 * the whole arrangement exists to protect. The compensation is that absence has
 * to be *loud*: {@link SchedulerRunner.status} carries `lastTickAt` so the
 * console can say "last tick: N minutes ago" (§4.1 point 6). A scheduler that
 * is merely not running looks exactly like one with nothing to do, and only
 * that timestamp tells them apart.
