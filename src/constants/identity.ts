/**
 * Which product identity this process runs as — the ONE signal that selects
 * between the occ default and the Qianmo node variant.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * occ already isolates itself from Anthropic's official Claude Code (`.occ` vs
 * `.claude`, separate cache/keychain/CLI name; see src/config/paths.ts). Qianmo
 * runs a THIRD identity on the same machine: a resident node that must not
 * touch either occ's or the official CLI's state. Rather than fork the ~200
 * call sites that consume BIN_NAME / occConfigDir(), both derivation modules
 * (src/constants/brand.ts and src/config/paths.ts) read the active identity
 * from HERE and resolve their per-identity values. Flipping one env var then
 * switches the whole config-dir / cache / CLI-name / socket-prefix surface
 * without editing a single consumer.
 *
 * READ ONCE, AT MODULE LOAD
 *
 * A process's identity is fixed the moment it starts, so this is a `const`
 * evaluated at import time, never re-read. Callers that need to exercise the
 * other identity must spawn a fresh process with a different `OCC_IDENTITY`.
 *
 * ZERO IMPORTS, ON PURPOSE
 *
 * brand.ts and paths.ts both sit on the startup keychain-prefetch path and must
 * stay cheap to load. This module imports nothing (it only reads `process.env`),
 * so pulling it into either of them adds no module-init cost. Keep it that way.
 */

/**
 * Every identity occ can present as, in a stable order — `occ` first, because
 * it is the default. This list is the roster: `IdentityMode` is derived FROM
 * it, so adding an identity means adding exactly one string here and then
 * fixing the `IdentityValues` call sites the compiler points at. There is no
 * second place that enumerates identities and could fall out of sync.
