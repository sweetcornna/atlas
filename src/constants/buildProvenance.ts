 * chunks carry no marker, and the only version string in the entrypoint is the
 * base's `"2.46.0"` — identical on every commit of this fork. So nothing on a
 * deployed machine could answer "which commit is this". The build now injects
 * `MACRO.SOURCE_COMMIT` (scripts/defines.ts); this module is how runtime code

 *
 * Deliberately a word and not `''`/`undefined`: every consumer is reporting
 * provenance to a human or to a report, and an empty field there reads as
 * "nobody filled it in" rather than "the build genuinely does not know".
 * Kept byte-identical to UNKNOWN_SOURCE_COMMIT in scripts/defines.ts.

 * fallback itself is gone since issue #81. `scripts/check-macro-guards.ts`
 * fails the build on that spelling.
