/**
 * Single source of truth for every path open-claude-code (occ) reads or writes.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * occ is a separate product from Anthropic's official Claude Code, and the two
 * must be able to run on the same machine without touching each other's state.
 * Before this module the fork shared essentially the whole official namespace:
 * `~/.claude/`, `~/.claude.json`, the `claude-cli` cache tree, the XDG
 * `claude/` install tree, and — worst of all — the same macOS keychain entry,
 * so logging into one CLI could overwrite the other's OAuth token.
 *
 * Every path must be derived here. Do not write `join(homedir(), '.claude')`
 * or `join(homedir(), '.occ')` anywhere else: nine such call sites existed
 * before this module and every one of them silently ignored the config-dir
 * override, which is why `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` isolation was already leaky.
 *
 * ENV PRECEDENCE
 *
 * `OCC_CONFIG_DIR` is the canonical override. `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is still
 * honoured as a deprecated fallback so that existing scripts, CI jobs and the
 * ~50 test files that set it keep working; it will be dropped in a later
 * release. Neither is consulted if the caller passes an explicit path.

 * The `LEGACY_*` names below are NOT switched — they always name the official
 * Claude Code directory, which every identity reads (read-only) for migration.

 * that second question wrong is invisible in single-identity testing and

 * only `.qianmo` and `.claude` will let a sandboxed command rewrite `~/.occ`
 * (which stores `.credentials.json`) and `~/.occ.json`. Both flavours below
 * are derived from the SAME literal pair, so they cannot drift.
