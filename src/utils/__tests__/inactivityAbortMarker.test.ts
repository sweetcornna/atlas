/**
 * A resident node's inactivity watchdog must not leave a transcript claiming a
 * user cancelled the turn (issue #39).
 *
 * The failure this pins was not that the turn failed — `timings.jsonl` had
 * that right, as `turn_failed: ResidentInactivityError`. It was that the
 * *other* record, the one an investigator opens first, said `[Request
 * interrupted by user]` on a machine nobody was sitting at, and reading it
 * ended the investigation. So the assertions here are about the two records
 * agreeing, and about the one downstream consumer that counts the string.
 *
 * No `mock.module` anywhere: every module under test is importable as-is.
