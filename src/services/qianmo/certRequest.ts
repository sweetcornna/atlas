/**
 * `qm cert request` — the node-side half of §6.1's certificate row 3.
 *
 * §6.1's table draws the line precisely: "生成节点 EC 密钥 + CSR + PoP" runs
 * **on the node itself**, and its whole output is a CSR plus a proof of
 * possession that get handed to the CA operator (`qm ca issue`, P12.1) — the
 * EC private key never leaves this machine. This file is that half.
 *
 * ## Why this shells out to openssl, and why not to `ca/openssl.ts`
 *
 * F-5 forces the TLS leaf onto an EC key, and `node:crypto` has no CSR
 * (PKCS#10) builder at all — generating one needs an external tool either
 * way, so this reaches for the same one `qm ca` does. It does **not** import
 * `ca/openssl.ts` to do it: `caScan.test.ts`'s reach pattern deliberately
 * names only `ca/pop.ts` and `ca/revocationList.ts` as nodes-may-reach-this
 * modules (its own header says so), and `ca/openssl.ts` is not one of them —
 * on purpose, the same way the CA directory itself is walled off (§3.3). A
 * node process shelling to openssl for its *own* CSR is a different, much
 * smaller privilege than a node process being able to reach the CA's signing
 * plumbing, and keeping them as two separate wrappers is what makes that
 * boundary mechanically checkable rather than a matter of not importing the
 * wrong thing today.
 *
 * ## What does get reached from `ca/`
 *
 * `popMessage` (`ca/pop.ts`) — deliberately node-reachable, per its own
 * module header: "P12.2's `qm cert request` builds its proof of possession
 * with popMessage". Nothing else.
