/**
 * The signed revocation list — RL, not an X.509 CRL (§6.4).
 *
 * §6.4 rejected three other options and the reasons are worth keeping next to
 * the code: an X.509 CRL would need a certificate library because `node:crypto`
 * cannot parse one, and adding a runtime supply chain for a format both ends
 * of which we control is a bad trade; short lifetimes alone would force the CA
 * online, destroying two of the three benefits §3.3 gets from it being offline;
 * and a status flag on the registry would put the revocation authority in a
 * house with no door (`console.md` §8.2 — anybody can write there).
 *
 * What is left is the cheapest thing that works: an ordinary JSON document
 * signed with `signBytes`, verified with `verifyBytes`, both already present
 * for capability tokens. **Zero new dependencies**, and the signature is what
 * makes it safe to hand the zero-auth registry as a courier — tampering is
 * detectable, so the registry only ever gets to be unavailable, never lying.
 *
 * ## The signature covers the bytes as delivered
 *
 * Same discipline as the capability token (protocol.md §10.1, roadmap v2.22 ①):
 * the payload travels base64url-encoded and is verified exactly as it arrived,
 * then parsed. Nothing re-serializes, so no canonical-JSON scheme has to be
 * agreed on, and "these two objects are equal but not byte-equal" cannot
 * happen. It is also why the artefact carries no human-readable copy of its
 * own contents: a second rendering of the same facts is a second thing to
 * disagree with the first (CLAUDE.md §1.1⑧). The CLI prints the decoded list.
