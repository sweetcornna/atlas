/**
 * The scan assertion §10.3 asks for, in the shape of `check:identity-paths`.
 *
 * Three separate claims, because they fail in three different ways:
 *
 * 1. **No node-side module knows where the CA lives.** §3.3 lists the places
 *    the CA private key must never appear — any node's config root, the demo
 *    root, the repository, CI, anything the console process can reach. A path
 *    literal is the only mechanism by which that could quietly stop being
 *    true, so exactly one file is allowed to spell one.
 * 2. **No `@qianmo/*` package can reach openssl or the CA.** §6.1's first hard
 *    constraint, restated as a DoD line: the signing tool is host-side, and
 *    node-side verification needs nothing but `node:crypto` (F-2).
 * 3. **The CA tool added no dependency.** §6.4 picked a signed JSON list over
 *    an X.509 CRL precisely to avoid pulling a certificate library into the
 *    runtime; an `import` of anything third-party here would undo that.
 *
 * ## Scope and exemptions, stated rather than implied
 *
 * Scanned: every `.ts` / `.tsx` under `src/` and `packages/`.
 *
 * Not scanned, on purpose:
 *   - `node_modules` and `packages/@ant/` — vendored and decompiled trees that
 *     are not ours to police (same exclusion as the session-key scan);
 *   - test files (`__tests__/`, `test/`, `*.test.ts`) — they assert against
 *     literals deliberately, exactly as `check-identity-paths.ts` reasons
 *     about `identityIsolation.test.ts`;
 *   - comments, which are stripped before matching, so prose may keep
 *     explaining the layout.
 *
 * Allowlisted (this IS the CA tool, not node-side code):
 *   - `src/services/qianmo/ca/**`
 *   - `src/cli/handlers/ca.ts`
 *
 * The reach rule below is narrower than the allowlist on purpose — see
 * {@link CA_REACH_PATTERN} for which two modules P12.2 may import, and why.
