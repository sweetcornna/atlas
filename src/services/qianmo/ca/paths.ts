 * Where the offline CA keeps its material (`key-distribution.md` §6.1).
 *
 * ## The one deliberate exception to CLAUDE.md §1.1②
 *
 * Every other user-level path in this repository is derived from
 * `src/config/paths.ts`. This one is NOT, and §6.1 spells out why in one
 * sentence: the CA private key must not live in *any* identity's config root.
 * §3.3 lists the places it is forbidden to appear — a node's config root and
 * everything derived from it, `DEMO_ROOT`, the repository, CI secrets, and
 * anything the console process can reach — and "under `occConfigPath(...)`" is
 * the first of those. Deriving this path from `paths.ts` would put it there.
 *
 * So the exception is the point, not an oversight, and the guard below makes
 * it enforceable rather than merely commented: {@link caDirectory} refuses any
 * directory that resolves inside a protected config root. The next person to
 * "顺手统一" this module will get a thrown error, not a silently relocated CA.
 *
 * ## Everything else here is a literal, and that is on purpose too
 *
 * §10.3 asks for a scan in the shape of `check:identity-paths`: CA directory
 * literals must not appear in node-side code. That is only checkable if there
 * is exactly one file where they DO appear — this one. `__tests__/caScan.test.ts`
 * is the scan; the allowlist there names this file.
