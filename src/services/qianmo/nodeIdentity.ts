/**
 * Where a node's Ed25519 key pair lives, and how it gets there (P4.3).
 *
 * `@qianmo/capability` deliberately owns no path convention, so this is the
 * file that does — and it derives every byte of the path from
 * `src/config/paths.ts` rather than joining `~/.occ` by hand (CLAUDE.md §1.1②).
 * That is not ceremony here: the Qianmo node identity is exactly the thing that
 * must not leak into the base's or the official CLI's config root, and a
 * hardcoded path is the one mechanism by which that isolation has actually
 * failed before.
 *
 * ## Load-or-create, and why the first writer wins
 *
 * A node's key *is* its identity: replacing it silently would invalidate every
 * capability it has issued and every published copy of its public key. So the
 * file is created exclusively (`wx`) and never overwritten. Two processes
 * racing to create one end with the same key, because the loser re-reads the
 * winner's file instead of clobbering it.
 *
 * ## Permissions
 *
 * Directory `0700`, file `0600`, and the mode is passed at creation rather than
 * chmod-ed afterwards — a window in which a private key is world-readable is
 * still a window. Same discipline as the acceptance artefacts in P1.3/P3.1.
