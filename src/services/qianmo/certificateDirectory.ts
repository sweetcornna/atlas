 * `CertificateDirectory` — the `--trust-ca` replacement for
 * `StaticPublicKeyDirectory` (key-distribution.md §8.1).
 *
 * Same {@link PublicKeyDirectory} interface `@qianmo/capability` already
 * defines, so nothing downstream of `publicKeyOf` changes. What is different
 * is where the keys come from: instead of a fixed map built once from
 * `--trust`, this one caches the registry's published certificates, checks
 * each against a local CA root and a revocation list, and refreshes itself
 * on its own clock.
 *
 * ## `publicKeyOf` stays synchronous, on purpose (§8.1, `token.ts:44-48`)
 *
 * The inbound capability gate calls `publicKeyOf` from inside a message
 * handler, before the sender has proven anything — a lookup that could block
 * would hand an unauthenticated peer control over how long that handler
 * takes. So every network call and every certificate check happens in
 * {@link CertificateDirectory.refresh}, off the hot path, and `publicKeyOf`
 * only ever reads a plain `Map` built by the last refresh. This is why the
 * class does its own verification up front rather than verifying lazily on
 * first lookup — a lazy design would put exactly the blocking work `token.ts`
 * forbids on the one method that must never block.
 *
 * ## Fail-closed, and to what (§6.4)
 *
 * A revocation list that is stale — `now >= nextUpdate`, including "never
 * fetched at all" — does not fail the directory open (every CA-derived key
 * still served) or closed (every lookup refused). It falls back to exactly
 * the explicit entries handed to the constructor or {@link put}, the same
 * set `--trust` has always populated. `#effective` is rebuilt on every
 * refresh so this degrade and its recovery are both silent and immediate —
 * there is no "stuck open" state to notice and clear by hand.
 *
 * {@link CertificateDirectory.handshakeCredentialOf} degrades the same way
 * and for the same reason, which is less obvious there because a certificate
 * *selector* survives the degrade too — see that method's own comment.
 *
 * ## What is verified here, and what is not
 *
 * A certificate must, in order: parse as a §4.2 binding, name the node it
 * was registered under, agree with any `publicKey` field alongside it,
 * verify against the configured CA root (F-2), be currently valid (not
 * before `notAfter`, not after — well, not *before* `notBefore` either), and
 * — only while the revocation list is fresh — not be on it. Any failure
 * drops that one node from the CA-derived cache; it does not throw, because
 * one bad record from a zero-auth registry (§5.2) must not stop every other
 * node from resolving.
 *
 * What this class does **not** do: verify the RL's own freshness against a
 * clock the operator cannot see (that is exactly {@link publicKeyOf}'s
 * fail-closed behaviour, not a bug to work around), or accept a certificate
 * this CA root did not sign, however well-formed its SANs are — that is
 * precisely T-B's "篡改者可以往注册中心塞一张伪造证书" case, and F-2 is the
 * whole reason it is checkable with zero additional trust.

   * An explicit entry is local operator authority and therefore wins even
   * when the peer also carries a certificate selector. Three properties of
   * that branch are load-bearing, and each one — quietly changed — turns into
   * a legitimate peer being closed with 4003.
   *
   * ① **The explicit key is served without a single CA-side check.** No RL
   *    freshness test, no `notBefore`/`notAfter` test, no revocation lookup.
   *    An operator who typed `--trust` already trusts that key
   *    unconditionally, and the way to withdraw it is to delete the entry,
   *    not to have the CA publish an RL.
   *
   * ② It follows that **a revoked or an expired fingerprint is still a valid
   *    proof selector.** The selector only says which bytes the peer's second
   *    proof was signed over (`certificate/<fingerprint>`); it takes no part
   *    in admission. The connection's effective credential stays
   *    `explicit/<node>`, so `closePeerCredentials([{node, 'certificate',
   *    F}])` will not close it. That is deliberate — it is the other half
   *    of ①, not an oversight.
   *
   * ③ `selector === node` means "the peer is claiming the explicit
   *    credential". This signature carries no `source` argument, so that
   *    equivalence rests entirely on the two key spaces being disjoint:
   *    `#explicit` is keyed by node segments (`@qianmo/protocol`'s
   *    `SEGMENT_PATTERN`, `/^[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9_-]{0,62}[a-z0-9])?$/`), while
   *    `#certificateFacts` is keyed by `fingerprint256` — upper-case hex with
   *    colons, `BC:3C:86:...`. Neither a colon nor an upper-case letter is a
   *    legal segment character, so no string can be both. Read this again
   *    before widening either key space.
   *
   * The one check a certificate selector does get is **contradiction, not
   * absence**. A retained fact binding this fingerprint to another node, or
   * to a key other than the explicit one, is refused — a conflict that sharp
   * is a configuration error worth surfacing. *No* retained fact is
   * **accepted**, because that is §6.4's degrade: a resident restarted while
   * the registry is unreachable has never pulled a `/v0/agents` row for
   * anyone, and refusing a peer that is right there on the `--trust` list
   * would turn "fail-closed 到 `--trust`" into fail-shut. Nor was the lookup
   * ever a security boundary — a peer holding the explicit private key can
   * take branch ③ instead and obtain a byte-identical effective credential;
   * both paths demand a signature from that same key.
   *
   * With no explicit entry the pure CA path applies, and it is strict in
   * every way the explicit branch is not: the selector must name a retained,
   * currently valid, unrevoked certificate for this node, and the RL must be
   * fresh. The method is intentionally synchronous, like {@link publicKeyOf}.

 *
 * `CertificateDirectory` verifies peers' certificates against a CA root; it
 * has no way to know what a peer's local identity file says, and it should
 * not — that would mean every node needing filesystem access to every other
 * node. This check is different in kind: it is a *local* consistency check a
 * node runs on its own `--cert` at startup, before it ever talks to anyone.
 * A node whose certificate was issued for a different key than the one it
 * actually holds cannot use that certificate for anything (its own
 * signatures will never match its own SAN), so refusing to start is strictly
 * better than starting broken.
 *
 * Returns the parsed binding on success; throws — never returns `null` —
 * because every call site here is a startup-time refusal, not a query.
