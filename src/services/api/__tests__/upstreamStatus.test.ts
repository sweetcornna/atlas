/**
 * The channel that lets an out-of-process observer see an HTTP status the
 * request itself already swallowed (issue #37 ②).
 *
 * The failure this closes: a resident node's inactivity watchdog runs in the
 * parent process, the ACP child is the only one that talks to a model
 * endpoint, and the retry ladders answer a 401 by quietly trying again. From
 * outside, a refused credential and a slow model are the same silence — which
 * is how a dead API key came back as "produced no activity for 120000ms".
 *
 * The second describe block drives the **real** OpenAI-compatible retry ladder
 * rather than asserting the reporter in isolation: the thing that regresses is
 * the call site, not the registry. No `mock.module` — `retry.ts` is importable
 * as-is, which is why the assertion can be about the ladder at all.
