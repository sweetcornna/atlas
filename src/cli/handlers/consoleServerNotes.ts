/**
 * Where the console keeps what an operator wrote about a machine.
 *
 * The same shape as `consoleChatStore.ts`, deliberately and for the same
 * reasons: an append-only NDJSON file, one record per line, replayed on start.
 * A partial write costs the last line rather than the file, and an unreadable
 * byte written during a power cut costs one note rather than the page.
 *
 * ## One kind of record, and it repeats itself
 *
 * `note` is written **again in full** every time a server's note changes, and
 * replay keeps the last record for each server. Not a patch log: a patch log
 * needs a merge function, and there is nothing here to merge — a note is one
 * string that a person replaced with another string.
 *
 * Volume makes this affordable and is worth stating so the next reader does not
 * generalise it: the writer is a person typing into a textarea, once per
 * machine, occasionally. **Compaction is a non-goal.** A fleet of nine machines
 * whose notes are rewritten daily for a year is under 3300 lines.
 *
 * ## What is *not* here
 *
 * The path. It arrives from `consoleArgs.ts`, derived from `occConfigPath()`
 * like every other identity-bearing path in this repository (CLAUDE.md §1.1②).
 * This module never joins a home directory to anything.
 *
 * The allowlist, too. This store writes whatever server id it is handed;
 * deciding that the id is one this console was started with belongs to
 * `http.ts`, next to the wake target check it copies (`ConsoleDeps.nodeServers`).
