/**
 * Does this node's model credential actually work?
 *
 * `warnMissingModelCredentials` answers a different, weaker question: is a
 * credential *visible*. A node whose API key had been revoked passed that
 * check, printed a clean banner, listened on its port, accepted tasks with
 * `receipt: "accepted"` — and then burned 120 seconds of silence per task
 * before reporting `ResidentInactivityError`, an error about model latency.
 * The endpoint had been answering `HTTP 401 {"error":"Invalid API key"}` in 44
 * milliseconds the whole time (issue #37).
 *
 * So this asks the endpoint. One request, the smallest the wire allows, at
 * startup, on the same environment the ACP child will inherit.
 *
 * ## What the verdict does and does not mean
 *
 * The question is deliberately narrow: **was the credential refused**. A 400
 * on a model id, a 404 on a path, a 500 from a gateway — all of those are
 * `reachable`, because they prove the request was authenticated far enough to
 * be judged on its merits, and none of them is something an operator should be
 * told to go rotate a key over. Only 401/403/407 are a refusal.
 *
 * That narrowness is also why the probe's model id barely matters: it is taken
 * from the same resolution the session will use, but a wrong one would still
 * answer the question being asked.
 *
 * ## Why it is hand-built rather than routed through the provider SDKs
 *
 * The SDK path drags in client caches, retry ladders and streaming assembly,
 * all of which exist to make a *turn* work and none of which help here — and
 * the retry ladders in particular would sit on a 401 for tens of seconds,
 * which is the very failure mode being diagnosed. A single `fetch` with an
 * injectable implementation is also the only shape that is testable without a
 * process-global module mock.
