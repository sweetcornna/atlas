/**
 * Bans the one spelling of a MACRO read that is wrong in every shipped bundle.
 *
 * `MACRO.*` is a compile-time substitution: the bundler (and `bun -d`) rewrites
 * the *member expression* `MACRO.VERSION` into a literal and leaves the bare
 * identifier `MACRO` exactly as written. Nothing ever defines that identifier,
 * so a guard written as
 *
 *     typeof MACRO !== 'undefined' ? MACRO.VERSION : 'unknown'
 *
 * survives minification as a live runtime test on a global that does not
 * exist. The irony is that the substitution succeeded — the literal is sitting
 * right there in the branch the test refuses to enter.
 *
 * Four call sites arrived at that spelling independently (issue #75): the
 * `version` field of every transcript entry, `doctor`'s reported version, the
 * Sentry release tag, and the API log's build age. Nothing caught them,
 * because under `bun test` MACRO is genuinely absent and the fallback branch
 * is genuinely correct — the tests and the artifact disagree about which
 * branch is live, and only the artifact ships. Three of the four were then
 * saved by luck: `entrypoints/cli.tsx` used to install a `globalThis.MACRO`
 * fallback before it loaded anything lazily, so late-loading modules found the
 * guard true. Anything in the entry's static import graph would not have — and
 * that fallback is gone since issue #81, which is what it was hiding.
 *
 * The spelling that works on both sides is `try`/`catch`, because it does not
 * ask a question at all — substituted, the body is a literal; unsubstituted,
 * the ReferenceError is caught. `src/constants/buildProvenance.ts` implements
 * it once per define; call those instead of reaching for MACRO yourself.
 *
 * Hard zero, no budget file. A ratchet would be the wrong instrument: there is
 * no legitimate use to grandfather, and every instance is a define silently
 * lost in production. Same posture as the extension rule in
 * check-mock-hygiene.ts.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun run scripts/check-macro-guards.ts
